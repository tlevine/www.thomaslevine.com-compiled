            <a href="http://opendatahandbook.org/en/why-open-data/">why we need open data</a> and 
            <a href="http://www.codeforamerica.org/09-24-2013/">how to release open data</a>.
            Part of the strategy for making open data useful is getting people to
            make <a href="http://youtu.be/6cRtbA_d4RI?t=12m40s">software</a> that use them.</p>

            To this end, 
            "[app](http://nycbigapps.com/)" [competitions](http://opendatachallenge.org/)
            
            http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LijchWVlirc
            -->
            
            <p>I’ve seen writing and talk about how to make software that uses open data,
            but it’s usually limited to an explanation that data exist on some website
            and maybe that you can query them with an “API”.</p>
            
            <p>I’ve lately been studying <a href="/open-data">data about open data</a>. Among other things,
            I now have some ideas of things that people should know if they’re making products
            that use open data. So here they are.</p>
            
            <p>In my mind, I have a particular category for software that connects to all the
            things and lets you make stuff from them. In composing the following thoughts,
            I was mainly thinking about this sort of software. But the thoughts might apply
            a bit more broadly.</p>
            
            <h2 id="storing-all-these-datasets">Storing all these datasets</h2>
            <p>With open data, you have lots of tiny datasets. The individual open datasets are
            usually small enough that any storage approach will be fine if you’re only using
            a few of them, but you’ll need to think a bit if you’re storing lots of datasets.</p>
            
            <h3 id="more-centralized">More centralized</h3>
            <p>Most people seem to start with storing everything in one relational database,
            with one database row per dataset row (possibly across tables or in one table).
            Examples include <a href="https://scraperwiki.com">ScraperWiki</a>,
            <a href="https://exversion.com">Exversion</a>, and
            <a href="https://socrata.com">Socrata</a></p>
            
            <h3 id="less-centralized">Less centralized</h3>
            <p>You probably don’t need your data to be this centralized. Well, at least that’s
            what I think, and that’s what ScraperWiki thought; ScraperWiki eventually switched
            to storing each dataset as a separate SQLite3 database. Actually, other aspects
            of the infrastructure have become much less centralized. And it makes sense that
            both ScraperWiki and I like this approach because I used to work there.</p>
            
            <p>In my <a href="/open-data">recent studies</a>, I’ve just been storing data as ordinary files on
            an ordinary filesystem and loading them all into memory. This is partly because I
            haven’t been particulary concerned with performance, but I think I’d do something
            quite similar if performance did concern me more; I load data into memory when I’m
            using them, and store them in a very simple way when I’m not using them.</p>
            
            <h2 id="conflation-of-publishing-with-consumption">Conflation of publishing with consumption</h2>
            <p>I think this is the interesting data-preparation issue with open data:
            Data are released by government/organization, but you might not be interested
            in data by government.</p>
            
            <h3 id="different-portals">Different portals</h3>
            <p>Paris publishes its data to the Paris data portal. This makes a lot of sense;
            Paris’s government has lots of data, and they’re just trying to get it out there
            in a place where people can find it.</p>
            
            <p>You can go to the Paris data portal and get data about
            <a href="">coffee</a> and
            <a href="">wifi</a>.
            Maybe you’re not interested in data specifically about Paris; maybe you’re
            actually interested in coffee and wifi in general. Or maybe you’re interested
            in a different subset, like wifi access in places other than cafes.</p>
            
            <p>People can consume Paris’s data by going to Paris’s data portal, but they might
            not be interested in data about Paris specifically. It would be nice to have one
            place with all of the relevant data, and your software can help with that.</p>
            
            <h3 id="relating-datasets">Relating datasets</h3>
            <p>Different cities are all still cities, so they collect similar data. But they
            have different policies and different bookkeeping practices, so not all of their
            data are out, and the data have different schemas. There are so many different
            people working on this that it’s not worth getting them to use the same procedures.</p>
            
            <p>But your product can help to connect all of these datasets. At the least, you can
            help people find out about related datasets. Build a fancier version of search;
            you might even call it a recommender.</p>
            
            <p>You can also get fancier about combining datasets. Figure out what schemas
            are common for particular sorts of data, and get different datasets into a reasonable
            schema so that you can query across all cities at once.</p>
            
            <p>This might sound like <a href="http://www.w3.org/standards/semanticweb/data">linked data</a>,
            and that can scare people. My advice above has similar goals to linked data, but I
            think we can accomplish some of them with simpler approaches than the Semantic Web
            technologies.</p>
            
            <h2 id="licensing">Licensing</h2>
            <p>You might be wondering what legal issues you’ll have to deal with if you use open data.
            Conveniently, the <a href="http://okfn.org/">Open Knowledge Foundation</a> <a href="http://opendefinition.org/">defines</a>
            open content as content for which you don’t have to deal with legal issues.</p>
            
            <blockquote>
              <p>A piece of data or content is open if anyone is free to use, reuse, and redistribute it — subject only, at most, to the requirement to attribute and/or share-alike.</p>
            </blockquote>
            
            <p>Inconveniently, a lot of open data sites <a href="/!/open-data-licensing">lack</a> open licenses.
            That said, it might still be fine to use data from these sites. Here are two reasons why.</p>
            
            <ol>
              <li>In the United States, you can’t copyright facts, so it’s likely a lot of datasets
             can’t be copyrighted. You can still restrict access to things, but you’d need to
             use a contract to impose such restrictions.</li>
              <li>The organizations that are releasing lots of data want the data to be used.
             If they don’t include a license or they include a restrictive license, I suspect
             that it’s just because they don’t know what to do.</li>
            </ol>
            
            <p>If you’re using data from a site without an obvious license, you might want to talk
            to a lawyer about it. Actually, you should totally do this and then tell me about it
            afterwards because I’m curious to hear more thoughts on the matter.</p>
            
            <h2 id="related-work">Related work</h2>
            <p>People have been dealing with this sort of issue inside of large organizations with
            lots of proprietary data, like investment banks. I’ve recently arrived at a bunch of
            ideas about how we can make open data better, but
            <a href="http://www.goldmansachs.com/">Goldman Sachs</a> (for example) figured
            this out years ago when they started having this variety of data internally.
            And they’ve already built out many of the things I suggest here.</p>
