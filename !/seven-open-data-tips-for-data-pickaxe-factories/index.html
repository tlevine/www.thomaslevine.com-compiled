            <hr>
            <p>I’ve heard that the real money in gold rushes was made by people selling
            pickaxes rather than by people mining gold. I’ve yet to find any convincing
            evidence of this, but it’s a nice narrative.</p>
            
            <p>With today’s hype about “open data”, there’s probably money to be made by
            selling peripheral “data” products. If you’re working on one of these data
            products, even if you haven’t been thinking about open data, here are some
            tips for you.</p>
            
            <p id="random-numbers">I noticed that this was becoming a listicle, but I didn’t have any special
            ordering for these tips, so I gave them all random numbers.</p>
            
            <h2 id="open-data-isnt-that-special">92. Open data isn’t that special.</h2>
            <p>People write and talk a lot about
            <a href="http://opendatahandbook.org/en/why-open-data/">why we need open data</a> and 
            <a href="http://www.codeforamerica.org/09-24-2013/">how to release open data</a>.</p>
            
            <p>Part of the strategy for making open data useful is getting people to
            make <a href="http://youtu.be/6cRtbA_d4RI?t=12m40s">software</a> that use them,
            so people even organize
            “<a href="http://nycbigapps.com/">app</a>” <a href="http://opendatachallenge.org/">competitions</a>
            around open data.</p>
            
            <p>It’s great if people want to use the open data, but it’s still just data.
            I’ve seen writing and talk about how to make software that uses open data,
            but it’s usually limited to an explanation that data exist on some website
            and maybe that you can query them with an “API”. And that’s because there
            isn’t anything special about it. But open data isn’t fundamentally different
            from any other files.</p>
            
            <h2 id="open-data-is-sort-of-special">73. Open data is sort of special.</h2>
            <p>There are some noteworthy characteristics that I see in open data, and these
            can mostly (all?) be thought
            of as issues with generic <a href="/!/what-is-open-data">sharing</a> of data. These
            come about when lots of people are updating and reading the same datasets,
            even when the data are only shared within a small company.</p>
            
            <p>Also, for the remainder of this article, when I say “open data”, I also mean
            “the generic sharing of data”.</p>
            
            <h2 id="consider-the-flow-from-publishing-to-consumption">50. Consider the flow from publishing to consumption.</h2>
            <p>Data are released from separate groups who collected the data
            (researchers, governments, organizations, &amp;c.)
            but you might not be interested in this grouping of data.</p>
            
            <h3 id="different-catalogs">Different catalogs</h3>
            <p>Paris publishes its data to the Paris data portal. This makes a lot of sense;
            Paris’s government has lots of data, and they’re just trying to get it out there
            in a place where people can find it.</p>
            
            <p>You can go to the Paris data portal and get data about
            <a href="http://opendata.paris.fr/opendata/jsp/site/Portal.jsp?document_id=167&amp;portlet_id=102">coffee</a> and
            <a href="http://opendata.paris.fr/opendata/jsp/site/Portal.jsp?document_id=125&amp;portlet_id=106">wifi</a>.
            Maybe you’re not interested in data specifically about Paris; maybe you’re
            actually interested in coffee and wifi in general. Or maybe you’re interested
            in a different subset, like wifi access in places other than cafes.</p>
            
            <h3 id="connecting-organizations-and-relating-datasets">Connecting organizations and relating datasets</h3>
            <p>Different cities are all still cities, so they collect similar data. But they
            have different policies and different bookkeeping practices, so not all of their
            data are out, and the data have different schemas. And, of course, all of the data
            are on different websites.</p>
            
            <p>As I see it, products like <a href="http://socrata.com">Socrata</a>, <a href="http://ckan.org">CKAN</a>,
            and <a href="http://opendatasoft.com">OpenDataSoft</a> wind up focusing much more on helping
            the publishers get the data out than on helping consumers find and use data.</p>
            
            <p>How do we help the consumers? Rather than getting everyone to adopt
            <a href="http://www.w3.org/standards/semanticweb/data">specific standards</a>,
            I think we can just roll with this and make products that fill this gap between
            the publisher and the consumer.</p>
            
            <p><img src="../data-about-open-data-talk-december-2-2013/unsilo.jpg" alt="Magic middle layer for consumers" /></p>
            
            <p>Products like <a href="http://enigma.io">Enigma</a> try fill this gap by making it easier
            for ordinary humans to find public data. If you take this further, you can wind
            up with something that feels more like a new dataset rather than a bunch of
            existing datasets; <a href="https://opencorporates.com">OpenCorporates</a> is an example of
            that.</p>
            
            <p>This sort of thing has surely been around for a while. I think Bloomberg and
            Palantir are this but with datasets that we don’t think of as “open”. Also,
            I don’t really know what “data warehousing” and “business intelligence” are,
            but the entirity of those fields might also fall into this category.
            And a bunch of nominally data “analysis” products do this to some degree
            as well.</p>
            
            <p>Recognizing this might give you some ideas.
            For example, if you want to publish your data to the world, don’t worry
            about <a href="/!/socrata-users">letting people make graphs from the data</a>; instead,
            just expose it as a simple file/API that people can find and make sense of,
            and let people use better products for that. Similarly, note that there’s
            a lot of data floating around that is hard enough just to find and that there
            is value in even being able to search them.</p>
            
            <h2 id="break-the-linear-flow-of-data-through-people">50. Break the linear flow of data through people.</h2>
            <p>There’s this idea that open data come from the government or a scientist and
            then someone uses them
            (and then profit or <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LijchWVlirc&amp;html5=1">humanity</a>).
            That is, some special person produces
            the data and then other people use them. If you see open data
            <a href="/!/what-is-open-data">as I do</a>, it doesn’t have to be this way.
            Wouldn’t it be cool if we could collaborate on the editing of datasets?</p>
            
            <p>To be clear, I still like the model of linear flow of data through purely
            functional pipes; I just think we should have these pipes go back and forth
            between separate people/organizations.</p>
            
            <h2 id="storing-your-datasets-can-be-simple">54. Storing your datasets can be simple.</h2>
            <p>If you’re storing lots of datasets, they’ll take up lots of space, but that doesn’t
            mean that your storage system needs to be complicated.</p>
            
            <h3 id="more-centralized">More centralized</h3>
            <p>Most people seem to start with storing everything in one relational database,
            with one database row per dataset row (possibly across tables or in one table).
            I’m told that this is how <a href="https://scraperwiki.com">ScraperWiki</a>
            and <a href="https://socrata.com">Socrata</a> started out,
            and a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnurrM06oyM">video</a> tells me that this
            is how <a href="https://exversion.com">Exversion</a> started out.
            If this is easy for you, do it.</p>
            
            <h3 id="less-centralized">Less centralized</h3>
            <p>You probably don’t need your data to be this centralized. You’ll have a lot of
            datasets, but most of them are probably pretty small. Thus, if you just store
            datasets in a simple way (like as ordinary files, maybe across a few computers),
            you’re probably fine. This simplifies things like backing up data and
            parallelizing across datasets.</p>
            
            <p>You might want to do something that involves lots of datasets, like grouping
            datasets by schema.
            In such cases, treat each dataset as an observation in a larger dataset, calculate
            whatever numbers/features/statistics you need, and put them into a new dataset.
            Said more fancy-like, apply/map across each of the datasets and combine the
            results into a new dataset.</p>
            
            <p>In my <a href="/open-data">recent studies</a>, I’ve just been storing data as ordinary files on
            an ordinary filesystem and loading them all into memory. This is partly because I
            haven’t been particulary concerned with latency, but I think I’d do something
            quite similar if that concerned me more.</p>
            
            <p>Perhaps I should mention that I apply this thinking more broadly; I think people
            jump to using fancy databases too quickly; much (most?) of the time, ordinary files
            work just fine.</p>
            
            <h2 id="the-licensing-is-not-always-clear">18. The licensing is not always clear.</h2>
            <p>You might be wondering what legal issues you’ll have to deal with if you use open data.
            Ideally, you wouldn’t have to worry about such things. In fact,
            the <a href="http://okfn.org/">Open Knowledge Foundation</a> <a href="http://opendefinition.org/">defines</a>
            open content as content for which you don’t have to deal with legal issues.</p>
            
            <blockquote>
              <p>A piece of data or content is open if anyone is free to use, reuse, and redistribute it — subject only, at most, to the requirement to attribute and/or share-alike.</p>
            </blockquote>
            
            <p>Less-than-ideally, a lot of open data sites <a href="/!/open-data-licensing">lack</a> open licenses.
            That said, it might still be fine to use data from these sites. Here are two reasons why.</p>
            
            <ol>
              <li>In the United States, you can’t copyright facts, so it’s likely a lot of datasets
             can’t be copyrighted. You can still restrict access to things, but you’d need to
             use a contract to impose such restrictions.</li>
              <li>The organizations that are releasing lots of data want the data to be used.
             If they don’t include a license or they include a restrictive license, I suspect
             that it’s just because they don’t know what to do.</li>
            </ol>
            
            <p>If you’re using data from a site without an obvious license, you might want to talk
            to a lawyer about it. Actually, you should totally do this and then tell me about it
            afterwards because I’m curious to hear more thoughts on the matter.</p>
            
            <h2 id="many-datasets-at-a-time">72. Many datasets at a time</h2>
            <p>With so much data, there is probably something you can find in publically available data
            that you can use to enrich your private data. For example, if your private data includes
            IP addresses of someone who clicked on an add, you can convert that to an approximate
            geographic location and then use public data to determine how common murder and trees are
            in that location.</p>
            
            <p>Open data might allow for a slightly different mode of exploring this stuff. It might take
            a lot of work/money to get a dataset, so it might not be worth doing that unless you know
            that it will be worthwhile. On the other hand, if data are freely accessible and
            free-of-charge, it might make sense to try out a bunch of datasets.</p>
            
            <p>Cool things happen when you combine datasets that you previously hadn’t combined.
            I want to see a product that helps people find datasets that they can incorporate
            into whatever analysis they are presently working on. Maybe it detects that your
            dataset is about counties and then suggests other datasets that are about counties.</p>
            
            <h2 id="random-numbers">Random numbers</h2>
            <p>As I said <a href="#random-numbers">earlier</a>, I chose the numbers above randomly.
            I sloppily sampled with replacement, and that’s how there are two 50s.</p>
