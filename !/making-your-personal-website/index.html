            <p>Making your own personal website might seem daunting, but
            it’s not hard if you break it into smaller steps.</p>
            
            <h2 id="recording-your-works">Recording your works</h2>
            <p>Start recording everything worth recording. Write
            it down, take video, or whatever. It doesn’t matter how
            you do it or how you organize things; just record things
            while you still remember them, and store them in a place
            you won’t lose them. (Email attachments are perfectly
            acceptable.)</p>
            
            <p>Before I had a good system, I stored things in email
            attachments, Google Docs, hard drives, Gitorious (git
            repositories), Tumblr, SmugMug, S3, Twitter, Facebook,
            a CouchDB, and in a 60-page book written in LaTeX.
            I probably used other places too.</p>
            
            <p><small>Fun fact: I named my 60-page book <em>The Dump</em>, after
            Maurice Benayoun’s <a href="http://www.the-dump.net/">The Dump</a>.</small></p>
            
            <p>The main thing is to get everything digital so that you can
            carry the stuff around and search through it easily.</p>
            
            <h2 id="write-about-your-stuff">Write about your stuff</h2>
            <p>You probably want to write a little something about each thing.
            At the very least, you probably want to give them a title.
            A paragraph and a date might be good too.</p>
            
            <p>I wrote these descriptions all over the place, but a lot were
            as captions on SmugMug. This was sort of a good idea, but only
            because I was uploading lots of pictures to SmugMug. The point
            is that you don’t need to have a fancy website before you can
            create content for the website.</p>
            
            <p>Also, <strong>don’t proofread</strong>. Well, more accurately, only proofread
            after you’ve posted something on the internet and a few hundred
            people have read it and complimented you on it. Nobody is ever
            going to see most of your stuff, so don’t waste time on making
            it good.</p>
            
            <h2 id="organizing-your-works">Organizing your works</h2>
            <p>Nobody other than you is going to read your website once
            you have it, at least at first, so don’t worry about
            designing it for other people. In fact, you don’t even need
            a website; just come up with some system that makes it
            easy for you to find the things you’ve recorded. I’ll
            divide my approach to this into two categories.</p>
            
            <ul>
              <li>Making a list</li>
              <li>Organizing files into a standard structure</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3 id="make-a-list">Make a list</h3>
            <p>If you’ve been using email attachments to store your works,
            you could just list the names of the works and search terms
            that will find them. I actually didn’t do this, but the point
            is that it doesn’t have to be fancy.</p>
            
            <p>I had already been doing this to some degree as I was recording
            things in my 60-page LaTeX book and in my SmugMug galleries.</p>
            
            <p>Most of everything else was already publically accessible on the web,
            so I mostly made a list of all of the links to them. I did this
            as a <a href="https://github.com/tlevine/www.thomaslevine.com/blob/c1e1302b2fe43bbe98902a08367bb4d01feea66e/content/index.html">webpage</a>,
            but you could do it in an email or blog post or whatever.</p>
            
            <h3 id="make-a-consistent-file-structure">Make a consistent file structure</h3>
            <p>For anything you have been storing as ordinary files, copy the
            files into a new place with standard naming conventions.
            I suggest the following structure.</p>
            
            <pre><code>things-i-did/name-of-thing/file-about-thing&#x000A;</code></pre>
            
            <p>For example,</p>
            
            <pre><code>things-i-did/middle-names/askcensus.eml&#x000A;things-i-did/middle-names/cornell_middle_names_by_school.png&#x000A;things-i-did/middle-names/us_middle_names_over_time_by_state.pdf&#x000A;things-i-did/middle-names/us_middle_names_over_time.png&#x000A;</code></pre>
            
            <p>Don’t worry yet about writing the web page about it.</p>
            
            <p><a href="https://github.com/tlevine/thomaslevine.com/tree/master/hack/blog">Here</a>’s
            me putting the things into directories before I was using my current
            website-generator system.</p>
            
            <h2 id="make-a-simple-website">Make a simple website</h2>
            <p>You wanted a website, so start putting stuff up on the web
            in whatever way is easy.</p>
            
            <p>I wound up with a list of links before I had nicely
            structured files, so I just put that up. It went through
            many incarnations, but here are a few.</p>
            
            <ul>
              <li>A bunch of files that I edited manually</li>
              <li>SmugMug photo gallery thing</li>
              <li>More files that I edited manually</li>
              <li>Pages generated from that 60-page LaTeX book with
              <a href="http://hevea.inria.fr/">HeVeA</a> and a hacky shell script</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>If you have nicely structured files and no other list, you
            could just dump them on a plain Apache web server,
            like <a href="http://chainsaw.thomaslevine.com/">this</a>.
            I suspect there’s even some fancy easy-to-use
            drag-files-somewhere-and-have-them-magically-served thing.</p>
            
            <p>I got this idea while talking with
            <a href="http://cooperation.io/">Marina</a>.
            Her site is a bunch of files served by a
            <a href="https://gist.github.com/mk30/8210642">wonderfully sloppy script</a>.</p>
            
            <h2 id="make-a-fancy-website">Make a fancy website</h2>
            <p>By now, you have a lot of nicely organized content on the web.
            This is still not quite what you want; the following things
            could be improved.</p>
            
            <ul>
              <li>You want it to be easy for you to add new material to the
              website.</li>
              <li>You want the website to look pretty.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>Now that you have a bunch of content, you can play around with
            a few different ways of arranging them fancy-like. So many
            possibilities! Here are two main things to think about.</p>
            
            <ul>
              <li>How to add new content</li>
              <li>How to manage the whole system</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>Don’t worry about making it pretty or easy for other people to use.</p>
            
            <h3 id="how-do-you-like-to-add-new-content">How do you like to add new content?</h3>
            <p>I like working with ordinary files, so I make new webpages by
            making new files inside of a terminal. But you might prefer to
            use a word processor on a website or to take videos with your phone.</p>
            
            <h3 id="how-can-you-make-this-whole-system-easy-to-manage">How can you make this whole system easy to manage?</h3>
            <p>Lots of
            things could go wrong when things get fancy like this. Pay attention
            to things that seem annoying, and come up with ways around this.
            Annoying things might include</p>
            
            <ul>
              <li>Maintaining whatever server you have</li>
              <li>The process for uploading new files to the site</li>
              <li>Having the appropriate software to edit your site</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>Try to keep this fancy system simple. When it has to be complicated,
            let the complicated things be either things you already understand
            well or things that you’ll learn quickly.</p>
            
            <h2 id="my-particular-website">My particular website</h2>
            <p>You probably want a website that isn’t exactly like mine, but it
            might be worth explaining how my website works right now. If you’re
            not the sort of person who knows what text files and Git are,
            you might want to <a href="#repeat">skip this section</a>.</p>
            
            <h3 id="copying-it">Copying it</h3>
            <p>But before I explain any further, I would like to note that
            you are welcome to base your website on mine; the source code
            is <a href="https://github.com/tlevine/www.thomaslevine.com">here</a>.</p>
            
            <p>The process for editing it is designed very specifically for me,
            so you might not like it. Also, it is not very well documented,
            but if you’re having trouble figuring out how it works, write to
            me, and I’ll document it better.</p>
            
            <p>If you want to use it, start by keeping all of the logic the same
            and just changing things in the <code>content/!</code> directory and in the
            <code>content/index.haml</code> file. Get something working, and worry later
            about making it look pretty.</p>
            
            <h3 id="notable-featurues">Notable featurues</h3>
            <p>If you don’t want to use it, you still might take some inspiration
            from some of the decisions I made</p>
            
            <h4 id="static-website-generator">Static website generator</h4>
            <p>My website doesn’t have anything where people log in or upload files
            or otherwise send input to the server. Thus, I can serve my website
            as ordinary files.</p>
            
            <p>Editing these files is annoying, so I use a static website generator that writes these files based on the simpler and less-annoying files
            with which I configure my website. I happen to use
            <a href="http://nanoc.ws/">nanoc</a>, but there are tons of them.</p>
            
            <h4 id="git">Git</h4>
            <p>It scares me to edit things without tracking their history. I settled
            a few years ago on using <a href="http://git-scm.com">Git</a> for this, so that’s
            what I use for versioning the all of the content on my website.
            (I’m right now making a distinction between content and logic.)</p>
            
            <p>When I build the site with nanoc, the resulting files go into the
            <code>output</code> directory, and then I upload them to a static file hosting
            service (more on that later).</p>
            
            <p>This <code>output</code> directory is a
            <a href="http://git-scm.com/book/en/Git-Tools-Submodules">git submodule</a>
            with just the resulting website. This is cool in case I ever can’t
            get nanoc working in the future; even if I can’t rebuild the site,
            I’ll be able to see what old versions looked like.</p>
            
            <h4 id="git-remotes">Git remotes</h4>
            <p>It also scares me to edit things without having multiple backups on
            different continents, so I have Git remotes. I used to use Gitorious,
            and I still have my own server that I push things to, but I wind up
            using GitHub a lot of the time. It works decently and isn’t annoying
            once you’ve set things up the first time, but I don’t like this
            because it’s proprietary</p>
            
            <h4 id="github-pages">GitHub Pages</h4>
            <p>If you already have everything in Git and you’ve already given in to
            proprietary GitHub software, you might as well use GitHub Pages to
            host your website. GitHub Pages serves a website from files committed
            to a Git repository.</p>
            
            <p>Recall that the compiled website goes into the <code>output</code> directory and
            that this directory is a git submodule. I push that submodule to
            GitHub, and it gets served through GitHub Pages.</p>
            
            <p>I must point out that there are some things I don’t like about GitHub
            Pages. First, as I said above, it’s proprietary. Second, I can’t serve
            different pages depending on the
            <a href="http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html">Accept-Language header</a>.</p>
            
            <h4 id="directory-structure">Directory structure</h4>
            <p>I went with this directory structure for pages.</p>
            
            <pre><code>/!/this-cool-thing/index.html&#x000A;/!/that-cool-thing/index.html&#x000A;</code></pre>
            
            <p>This results in two pages, one at
            <code>http://thomaslevine.com/!/this-cool-thing</code>,
            and the other at
            <code>http://thomaslevine.com/!/that-cool-thing</code>.</p>
            
            <p>This structure is nice because it gives me a place to put more
            than one file per page.</p>
            
            <pre><code>/!/this-cool-thing/index.html&#x000A;/!/this-cool-thing/picture-of-thing.jpg&#x000A;/!/that-cool-thing/index.html&#x000A;/!/that-cool-thing/ugh-microsoft-word.docx&#x000A;</code></pre>

            <p>I just explained how my site works, but you are probably not a clone
            of me. Starting with my ideas might not be a bad idea, but try to come
            up with something that suits you better.</p>

            <p>It’s not like each of these steps only happens once.
            I still have at least half a lifetime of stuff that I’ve written about, 
            photographed, &amp;c. but haven’t published on my website. I periodically
            go through those old things and copy them to the site.</p>

            <p>Making your personal website might seem daunting, but it’s easy if you
            break it into tiny pieces. Start by saving everything. Once you have
            a lot of things, organize them and write about them. Don’t worry very
            much at first about making the website pretty; just get things started.
            And in designing your website, focus on making it easy for you to add
            content rather than on making it pleasant for other people to view.</p>
