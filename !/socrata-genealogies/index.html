            <p>As the Twitters have pointed out, the dataset counts that I presented

            <p>Many of the things that I was calling a dataset can be seen as a
            copy or a derivative of another dataset. In this post, I’ll discuss</p>
            
            <ol>
              <li>Socrata concepts and terminology</li>
              <li>ways that we can arrive at apparent duplicates in Socrata data</li>
              <li>the progeny of nine Socrata datasets</li>
              <li>ideas for future study</li>
            </ol>
            
            <h2 id="socrata-terminology">Socrata terminology</h2>
            <p>Most of my work on this for the past week has been figuring out
            Socrata’s terminology and schema. Let’s define some Socrata terms.</p>
            
            <h3 id="everything-is-a-view">Everything is a view</h3>
            <p>When you go to the home page of a Socrata portal, you can
            “Search &amp; Browse Datasets and Views”. This phrasing is sort
            of wrong. “<strong>view</strong>” is just a generic concept that refers
            to any sort of file or data that is presented to a user.</p>
            
            <p>Everything in that list on the home page is a view. I haven’t
            yet explained what a dataset is, but a dataset is a type of
            view. For example, the top two views in
            <a href="https://explore.data.gov/">explore.data.gov</a> are currently (July 17)
            <a href="https://explore.data.gov/dataset/White-House-Visitor-Records-Requests/644b-gaut">White House Visitor Records Requests</a>
            and <a href="https://explore.data.gov/dataset/White-House-Visitor-Records-Requests/644b-gaut">U.S. Overseas Loans and Grants (Greenbook)</a>.</p>
            
            <p><a href="https://explore.data.gov/"><img src="search-browse.png" alt="Search &amp; Browse Datasets and Views" /></a></p>
            
            <p>You also get a list of “View Types”. Below, I define some
            of these view types.</p>
            
            <h3 id="datasets">Datasets</h3>
            <p>Let’s start with the <strong>dataset</strong>.
            A dataset is when you get when you upload data to Socrata in one of
            its supported tabular formats.</p>
            
            <h3 id="filtered-views">Filtered views</h3>
            <p>Before I define “filtered views”, I want to explain why they exist.
            Socrata helps people publish their data by providing various APIs
            for importing from different data sources, and Socrata helps people
            consume data by providing a data analysis suite inside the web browser.
            This includes maps and graphs and whatnot that you can embed in
            websites rather than just in PDF documents.</p>
            
            <p>Socrata also allows you to “Filter”
            datasets. For example, here I filter the list of
            <a href="https://data.oaklandnet.com/Environmental/Public-Works-Volunteer-Opportunities/sduu-bfki">Public Works Volunteer Opportunities</a>
            to include only opportunities on July 29.</p>
            
            <p><a href="filter.png"><img src="filter.png" alt="Filtering on date July 29" /></a></p>
            
            <p><a href="https://data.oaklandnet.com/Environmental/Volunteer-Opportunities-on-July-29/vyhb-nqtw">Here</a>’s the resulting filtered view.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Filtered views</strong> are queries on a dataset. The queries are represented internally in the
            <a href="http://dev.socrata.com/deprecated/querying-datasets">SODA filter query language</a>.</p>
            
            <h3 id="charts-and-maps">Charts and maps</h3>
            <p><strong>Charts</strong> and <strong>maps</strong> are also queries on a dataset.
            The difference between filtered views, charts and maps is quite subtle.
            They are all queries on datasets; they just display a different
            visualization when you view them on the Socrata website.</p>
            
            <p>There are other types of views, but we don’t need to know about them
            for now.</p>
            
            <h3 id="tables">Tables</h3>
            <p>There is also a concept of a <strong>table</strong>, and
            it is somewhat abstract. Here are two ways of thinking of it.</p>
            
            <p>First, a more conceptual explanation.
            After someone uploads a dataset, a variety of filtered views,
            charts and maps can emerge. I see this as a family of views,
            with the parent being the original dataset and the ancestors
            being all of the filtered views, charts and maps that make
            SODA queries on the original dataset. In Socrata, this family
            is called a table.</p>
            
            <p>Next, a more technical explanation.
            The data are stored in a table, and this table is not exposed directly to users. 
            The most raw form of the table is exposed through a dataset, which is an empty
            query on the dataset (equivalent to <code>SELECT * FROM table_name;</code>). Filtered views,
            charts and maps act on the table rather than on the source dataset; they’re just
            like datasets, except that they include a query.</p>
            
            <h3 id="federation">Federation</h3>
            <p>Socrata doesn’t provide a particularly obvious means for searching multiple
            data portals at once. (This was part of my motivation for downloading all of
            the datasets.) But it is possible for one data portal to include all of
            another portal’s datasets.</p>
            
            <p>Sometimes, you’ll see a view in the search &amp; browse pane with a grey background,
            instead of white. Hawaii has a bunch of these.</p>
            
            <p><a href="https://data.hawaii.gov/"><img src="hawaii.png" alt="Hawaii data portal" /></a></p>
            
            <p>These views are “provided” by other portals through a process called
            “federation”. The destination portal (data.hawaii.gov in the above screenshot)
            makes a request to the source portal (data.explore.gov in the above screenshot)
            to federate the source portal’s data.</p>
            
            <p>This request shows up in the administrator interface for the source portal.
            If the source portal accepts the request, all of the views from the source portal
            are provided to the destination portal as in the screenshot above.</p>
            
            <p>If you look closely, you’ll notice that the federated views are actually just
            links to the source portal; the views show up in the search, but they aren’t
            otherwise copied to the destination portal.</p>
            
            <h2 id="types-of-duplicate-datasets">Types of duplicate datasets</h2>
            <p>Now that you know a bit more about how Socrata works, I can explain my three
            categories of datasets-that-I-counted-twice.</p>
            
            <h3 id="soda-queries-filtered-views-charts-maps">SODA queries: Filtered views, charts, maps</h3>
            <p>After a dataset is uploaded, people can create many views that derive from it.
            Depending on what you want to know, it might not make sense to treat these as
            separate entities.</p>
            
            <p>In my previous analysis, I did count filtered views, charts and maps all as separate
            entities. I think it’s worth separating these because they can be derived from the
            source datasets.</p>
            
            <p>If people are using Socrata as it is intended, there should be tons of filtered
            views, charts and maps, and they’ll give us an interesting picture of how the
            portal is being used.</p>
            
            <h3 id="federation-1">Federation</h3>
            <p>When datasets are federated, <em>all</em> of the datasets from the source portal are
            provided to the destination. (You can’t pick and choose.) That is, they show up
            in search as links to the source portal.</p>
            
            <p>In my previous analysis, I counted federated datasets as belonging to the portal
            to which they’re provided. Also, I downloaded them in a way that made it hard for
            me figure out what the source portal was. It’s easy to fix, so I might download
            them all again and graph the network of federation across Socrata portals.</p>
            
            <p>(For those who are curious, the issue was that I followed HTTP redirects and
            didn’t record whether I was following a redirect or accessing the page directly.)</p>
            
            <h3 id="copied-rather-than-elegantly-linked">Copied rather than elegantly linked</h3>
            <p>Some datasets have simply been uploaded to two different portals.
            Lombardia’s museums is an example of that.</p>

              </tbody>
            </table>
            
            <p>I identified this group by looking for datasets with the same numbers of rows,
            the same number of columns, and similar names.
            I haven’t done it on a larger scale, but that would be fun to do later.</p>
            
            <h2 id="nine-large-dataset-families">Nine large dataset families</h2>
            <p>It took me quite a while to figure out how all of this works.
            (That’s a story in itself.) My goal all along was to start looking
            at how families of datasets are related. I figured I’d make something
            a bit less sloppy than ggplot plots tiny text and with legends
            hanging off of the page.</p>
            
            <h3 id="methodology">Methodology</h3>
            <p>I grouped all of the views that I had collected by table. (Recall that
            a table in Socrata is a dataset plus the family of views that derives
            from that particular dataset.)</p>
            
            <p>Once I had grouped them, I found the ten largest families, by number of
            different views. To be clear, this is the number of Socrata entities
            called “views” rather than the number of times people viewed the dataset.
            (Confusingly, Socrata also provides the latter sort of view count, and 
            I’ve included that figure in the present report.)</p>
            
            <p>Out of these datasets, I took out nine of the top ten datasets, and I
            show their families in the table at the end of this page. Select a dataset,
            and then you can see all of that dataset plus all of the filtered views,
            maps and charts of that dataset. You can also see which portals each of
            these datasets is federated to. You can sort by the different columns,
            and you can click on a row to see more detail.</p>
            
            <h3 id="caveats">Caveats</h3>
            <p>The one dataset that I skipped is 
            <a href="https://explore.data.gov/Contributors/FEC-Contributions/4dkz-64bn?">FEC contributions</a>.
            I skipped it because some of the child views appeared to be in different portals.
            I’m not really sure what’s going on there; we can worry about that one some other time.</p>
            
            <p>And In case you’re reading this a year later, the data were collected from
            Socrata portals at the end of May 2013.</p>
            
            <h3 id="why-its-not-a-tree">Why it’s not a tree</h3>
            <p>In Socrata, you can create a filtered view, chart or map based on a dataset,
            and the link to the source dataset will be preserved. This is represented
            in the table below.</p>
            
            <p>Unfortunately, the genealogy is not recorded any deeper than this; if you
            create a new filtered view based on an existing filtered view, the SODA query
            is simply combined between the two views, and the new filtered view is
            represented as a child of the original dataset rather than a child of the old
            filtered view.</p>
            
            <h2 id="future-research">Future research</h2>
            <p>Before you scroll down to the table of dataset progeny, I’m going to comment
            on some ideas for future study that I’ve come up with. I’ve already alluded to
            some future study above; belowe, I’m focusing on things that I haven’t really
            discussed above.</p>
            
            <p>A small note on grammar:
            I talk about these studies as if I’m going to do them, but that’s just because
            I normally find that easier than convincing other people to help; all of the code
            and data is free/libre/open, so you can also help or do these yourself rather
            than waiting for me.</p>
            
            <h3 id="users">Users</h3>
            <p>As far as I could tell, Socrata’s API doesn’t make it particularly easy to
            get a list of all of the users, so I started with views. But now I have
            a list of all of the users who have created views, which is close enough to
            the list of all of the users. I’d like to see who is creating views, what
            sorts of views they’re creating. I’m particularly interested in ordinary
            citizens who are creating lots of views.</p>
            
            <h3 id="socrata-features">Socrata features</h3>
            <p>Socrata sells a bunch of add-on integration features. I’m somewhat curious to
            see which cities are using which features, and we can determine this based on
            the sorts of data that are in each portal.</p>
            
            <h3 id="data-quality">Data quality</h3>
            <p>A couple months ago, <a href="https://twitter.com/ag_dubs">Ashley Williams</a> and I
            <a href="http://www.appgen.me/audit/report">prototyped</a> a tool for identifying
            data quality issues in the data portal. We had a
            <a href="http://www.appgen.me/audit">slew of best practices</a> that we had found to
            be frequently violated in the New York data portal, but we didn’t know
            enough about Socrata to evaluate them properly. Many of these were already
            on my list for further study, but I got some more ideas on this front
            through my conversation with <a href="https://twitter.com/nneditch">Nicole Neditch</a>,
            who administrates Oakland’s data portal.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Codebooks</strong>: Socrata doesn’t really have a feature for including
            explanations of what the different variables in a dataset mean. (I’d call
            this a data dictionary or a codebook.) However, some datasets may already
            include codebooks. I’m personally just a bit curious as to which datasets
            have codebooks and whether that impacts their use. But this could also work
            its way into our hypothetical tool. For example, we could look for datasets
            with lots of views and without codebooks; those might be useful datasets
            to write codebooks for.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Geocoding</strong>: Socrata is quite slow at geocoding. Nicole suspects that
            this is because all of the geocoding for all of the portals runs on
            one server. This is something that Socrata could improve, but there’s
            a lot that cities can already do about this. This issue came up in relation
            to Oakland’s <a href="https://data.oaklandnet.com/Public-Safety/CrimeWatch-Maps-Past-90-Days/ym6k-rx7a">CrimeWatch maps</a>.
            The dataset has geospatial coordinates, is quite long, and is updated
            frequently. Every time it is updated, all of the geocoded coordinates
            get cleared, and the geocoding restarts, so the geocoding never finishes.
            Oakland actually has the geospatial data in its database, but through
            some accident, it wasn’t appearing in the dataset. If we could identify
            datasets like these, we could fix geocoding problems before people complain about them.</p>
