The Administration has expanded the data center consolidation initiative to include data centers of any size, rather than just those 500 square feet and above. And as we expand the initiative we are also expanding our goal. Moving forward, the government\u2019s goal will be to close at least 40% of identified data centers, consistent with our original consolidation goal. By expanding the initiative to include data centers of any size, we expected the baseline to increase. We now have a comprehensive inventory of all data centers varying in size. Although our baseline has increased, we are still committed to consolidate over 1200 data centers by the end of 2015 \u2013 a goal that requires us to continue aggressively rooting out duplication and waste.
