            <p>I was pondering whether anyone had ever given me particularly insightful
            unsolicited advice, and I didn&#8217;t manage to come up with any such situations.
            Aside from suggesting that I should solicit advice (because I could think of
            useful advice that I&#8217;d solicited), this led me to ponder whether following
            unsolicited advice should be any better than ignoring it.</p>
            
            <h2 id="who">Who</h2>
            <p>For some categorizations of people, both solicited and unsolicited advice
            come from the same sorts of people. If I ask someone for advice, be she a
            teacher, enemy, stranger, parent, friend, she might respond; or if I don&#8217;t,
            she might say something anyway.</p>
            
            <h2 id="differences">Differences</h2>
            <p>People have told me that different from the people for whom their unsolicited
            advice is mainly intended; I think the supposed difference is generally that I&#8217;m
            &#8220;smart&#8221; or that I &#8220;think&#8221; about things. Hmm. Perhaps there are relevant
            systematic differences between the sort of person who would give advice without
            solicitation and the sort of person who would listen to it. </p>
            
            <h3 id="how-much-people-talk-and-listen">How much people talk and listen</h3>
            <p>Consider a civilized conversation between two people, where one person listens
            when the other talks. Let&#8217;s measure amounts of talking or listening in time,
            and lets figure that both sides convey some advice. Now, let&#8217;s measure the time
            spent giving advice. (Let&#8217;s ignore how we would categorize something as advice.
            Or maybe everything is advice.)</p>
            
            <p>In some cases, we&#8217;ll find that one person talks much more than the other. Now
            let&#8217;s consider multiple conversations between the same people. Let&#8217;s say that
            this pair is the sort where different conversations tend to have a similar
            division of time spent advising/talking. (So maybe one person tends to
            talk/advise for about two-thirds of each conversation, and the other for about
            one-third.)</p>
            
            <p>In this case, one person provides twice as much advice than he receives, and
            the other provides half of what he receives. That&#8217;s interesting.</p>
            
            <p>Also, why are they talking different amounts? Maybe one wants to talk more than
            the other does. Maybe one wants to listen more than the other. Both of these
            might be specific to the context, of course; maybe this division happens
            one feels more qualified or authorized to talk or to listen. The one who is
            talking more might be a salesperson who is paid to talk or a respected, wise
            elder, to whom the other is posing questions on the nature of life.</p>
            
            <p>This situation shows how there could be relevant systematic differences between
            the sort of person who would give advice and the sort who would listen to advice.</p>
            
            <h3 id="thresholds-for-taking-things-seriously">Thresholds for taking things seriously</h3>
            <p>Grossly simplifying human language, let&#8217;s consider all adjective phrases to
            be interpreted by people as having a direction and a magnitude.</p>
            
            <p>For example, &#8220;hungry&#8221; could have a direction of &#8220;hunger&#8221; and a magnitude of
            &#8220;sort of&#8221;, and &#8220;fasmished&#8221; could have the same direction of &#8220;hunger&#8221; but a
            magnitude of &#8220;very&#8221;. To someone else, the words might have the same direction
            of &#8220;hunger&#8221; but have different magnitudes magnitude; &#8220;hungry&#8221; might be &#8220;very&#8221;,
            and &#8220;famished&#8221; might have a magnitude of &#8220;deathly&#8221;.</p>
            
            <p>Adding adverbs can, of course, modify the magnitude of the phrase; consider
            &#8220;sort of hungry&#8221;, &#8220;hungry&#8221; and &#8220;deathly hungry&#8221;.</p>
            
            <p>And let&#8217;s put opposites on the same scale; &#8220;full&#8221; might have a direction of
            &#8220;hungry and a magnitude of &#8220;not at all&#8221;.</p>
            
            <p>Let&#8217;s consider people to have a baseline magnitude and to have different
            magnitudes for different directions. By &#8220;baseline&#8221;, I mean that this is the
            strength of word that they use to describe a typical situation. They&#8217;ll also
            different baselines for different directions.</p>
            
            <p>If I had the numbers, I might model this as different people having different
            baselines that are randomly distributed around some center and as different
            within-person directions having their own baselines.</p>
            
            <!-- Draw a picture of that. -->
            
            <p>Now that that&#8217;s all explained, I can get to the point. Consider a conversation
            between a person with a high baseline magnitude (Call her Amy.) and a person
            with a low baseline magnitude. (Call her Betty.) Let&#8217;s say their views are
            equally strong/weak. Despite that, Amy might see Betty&#8217;s speech/advice as less
            strong than Betty would see Amy&#8217;s advice.</p>
            
            <p>For example, Amy might say &#8220;You definately need to read that book.&#8221; where Betty
            might say &#8220;I think you should consider reading that book&#8221;. To Amy, the first
            version might be medium-strong, and the other might be weak. To Betty, the
            first version might be super-strong, and the other might be medium-strong.</p>
            
            <p>In this situation, the person who uses strong language receives seemingly weak
            advice, and the person who uses weak languages receives seemingly strong
            advice. I think this distinction between baseline language strength is
            relevant, but I might put off that discussion to some other writing.</p>
            
            <h3 id="relationships-between-competence-and-manner-of-speech">Relationships between competence and manner of speech</h3>
            <p>I find that people use more jargon, act more like they know what they&#8217;re doing,
            and talk more in general when they don&#8217;t (in hopes to seem like they do).
            This could translate to giving more advice or to giving stronger advice. If
            this is the case, people who don&#8217;t know what they&#8217;re doing would be giving more
            advice or stronger advice than people who do know what they&#8217;re doing.</p>
