Subject: Two quick things
From: Paul Dechov

Thomas,

- Your frontier work with open data (and behind it) is enlightening and
inspiring

- I want to encounter all original data and I'm not interested in
derivative or duplicate -- in your opinion, can I safely filter portals on
the "Dataset" view type?

Paul
