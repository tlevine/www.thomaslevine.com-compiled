            <p>“Protocol” is one of those words that sounds more special than it is.
            The concept of a computer protocol might sound quite complex, but
            it’s a rather generic concept that is something like a language,
            an expectation, and a social norm.</p>
            
            <p>The way a particular protocol works might be quite complicated, but
            I just want to explain the generic concept of a protocol. I’ll explain
            this through two example protocols.</p>
            
            <h2 id="the-street-sign-protocol">The street sign protocol</h2>
            <p><img src="street-signs.jpg" alt="Street signs" />
            <!-- http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2132/2302062601_dd0f89779d.jpg
                 http://oaklandwiki.org/Street_Signs --></p>
            
            <p>First, I’ll document a protocol that we might not usually think of a
            protocol. Let’s call it the Street Sign Protocol (SSP).</p>
            
            <p>To keep things simple, I’ll actually document a simple version of the
            Street Sign Protocol. Let’s call it the Simple Street Sign Protocol (SSSP).</p>
            
            <h3 id="specification">Specification</h3>
            <p>SSSP is a way of exchanging the names of <em>streets</em>. It involves
            <em>street signs</em> mounted on <em>poles</em> near the <em>corners</em> of
            <em>four-way intersections</em>. Let’s define these terms.</p>
            
            <ul>
              <li>A <em>street</em> is a paved public thoroughfare in a built environment.
              (This definition is taken from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Street">Wikipedia</a>.)</li>
              <li>A <em>four-way intersection</em> is a place where two streets cross.
              Its shape is approximately a rectangle, with one side having the
              width of one street and the other side having the width of the
              other street.</li>
              <li>Being rectangular, a four-way intersection has four <em>corners</em> at the
              usual places.</li>
              <li>A <em>pole</em> is a long cylinder sticking out of the ground.</li>
              <li>A <em>street sign</em> is a flat rectangular thing that has text on both faces.
              The sign is oriented such that the text reads left-to-right.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>Next, let’s discuss what is expected of all of the.</p>
            
            <p>Each four-way intersection has four corners, and each pole is associated with
            a corner of an intersection. Each corner must have zero or one poles, and at least
            one of the corners of a four-way intersection must have a pole; thus, an
            intersection must have between one and four poles.</p>
            
            <p>Poles must be mounted within about ten feet of a corner of the intersection
            but not on the paved area of the street or the intersection. (It is okay for them
            to be mounted on the sidewalk.) It must stick straight out of the ground; the long
            axis of the cylinder must be approximately in line with the direction of gravity.</p>
            
            <p>Each street sign displays the name of one street. The street sign must include the
            name of the street in very large text. This name must be written on both faces of
            the sign and must be especially easy to see, even at night.</p>
            
            <p>Street signs are mounted on poles, each pole having exactly two street signs.
            The street signs must be aligned in a particular way. One of the faces must be
            just-barely-touching (tangent) the pole. The sign must also line up with its
            corresponding street; that is, the wide axis of the rectangular sign must run
            parallel the corresponding street.</p>
            
            <p>Each pole must contain two street signs, each one corresponding to a different
            one of the two streets at the four-way intersection.</p>
            
            <h3 id="implementing-a-sssp-writer">Implementing a SSSP writer</h3>
            <p>Here is one possible procedure for encoding street names in SSSP. This procedure
            expects a four-way intersection and the names of the two streets as input. It
            outputs SSSP (two street signs mounted to a pole near the intersection).</p>
            
            <ol>
              <li>Determine which corner(s) of the intersections the street signs should be
             mounted on. You might consider the locations of buildings, the presence
             of sidewalks, the traffic patterns and the presence of visual obstacles
             like trees.</li>
              <li>Print the signs with the street names.</li>
              <li>Cast a pole.</li>
              <li>Put a pole and street signs on a truck.</li>
              <li>Drive the truck to the intersection, and park nearby.</li>
              <li>Carry the materials and some tools to the intersection.</li>
              <li>Stick the pole in the ground near the chosen corner. I imagine that this
             involves putting up caution tape, digging a hole, securing the pole, pouring
             some concrete and covering it back up, but I don’t really know. If this were
             software, I’d try to use separate pole-installation library so I don’t have
             to implement the pole-installation procedure myself.</li>
              <li>Mount the street signs to the pole. Position them about ten feet above the ground,
             with one on top of the other and with the centers of the signs touching the pole,
             and otherwise in the appropriate orientations specified by the protocol. Secure
             them with a sign bracket.</li>
              <li>Drive the truck back to wherever you got it from.</li>
            </ol>
            
            <h3 id="implementing-a-sssp-reader">Implementing a SSSP reader</h3>
            <p>Here is a procedure for decoding SSSP. It has the opposite inputs and outputs as
            the SSSP writer.</p>
            
            <ol>
              <li>Look for poles with street signs at the four corners of the four-way intersection.</li>
              <li>Focus on the first valid pole that you see; ignore any others.</li>
              <li>Do the following for each of the two street signs.</li>
              <li>Read the large text on the sign.</li>
              <li>Associate this large text with the street that the sign lines up with.</li>
            </ol>
            
            <h2 id="hypertext-transfer-protocol">Hypertext Transfer Protocol</h2>
            <p>Now let’s talk about something that people actually call a protocol.
            Here’s a simplified version of the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)</p>
            
            <h3 id="highly-simplified-specification">Highly simplified specification</h3>
            <p>HTTP is a way of exchanging commands between a web browser and a web server.
            It is represented as a very long series of words, punctuation and spaces.</p>
            
            <p>Some messages have a <em>body</em>. This is an embedded series of words, punctuation
            and spaces that can be written in any format you want. (You could use this to
            write another protocol on top of HTTP.)</p>
            
            <p>Each message may have a bunch of <em>headers</em>. Each header has a name and a value.
            There are a bunch of headers that provide some information about the body
            (like its size or format), and there are a bunch of headers that provide
            information about the system that is sending the message. And there are others,
            like the date of the message.</p>
            
            <p>Each message is either a request or a response. By being a request, a message
            indicates that it came from a web browser and is being sent to a web server.
            By being a response, a message indicates that it came from a web server and
            is being sent to a web browser. Each response sent from a particular server
            to a particular browser must be initiated by a request sent from the
            particular browser to particular server.</p>
            
            <p>Every response has a body (explained above) and a status code. The status code
            is a number that explains whether the request succeeded and any quirks about its
            success or failure. For example, status code <code>200</code> means that the request worked
            as expected, and status code <code>403</code> means that the web browser is not allowed to
            run the command that it requested.</p>
            
            <p>Each request must have a method. There are a bunch of methods, and you can think
            of them as different commands. Here are a few of them.</p>
            
            <ul>
              <li><code>POST</code> is the method that asks the server to save a new document.
              It contains a body.</li>
              <li><code>PUT</code> is the method that asks the server to edit an existing document.
              It contains a body.</li>
              <li><code>GET</code> is the method that asks the server to send an existing document in the
              body of the response (and not to alter it). The request does not contain a body.</li>
              <li><code>HEAD</code> is the method that asks the server to do everything that it would do in
              for an equivalent <code>GET</code> request except for sending the body. Like the <code>GET</code>
              request, the <code>HEAD</code> request contains no body.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3 id="receiving-and-reading-and-writing-and-sending">Receiving and reading and writing and sending</h3>
            <p>A bunch of things in your web browser might initate a request. For example, opening
            a web page makes one request, and loading an image on the web page makes another request.</p>
            
            <p>The web server receives the request, checks that it is valid, and breaks it into the
            component method, headers, and body. Then the web server asks something else to decide
            what to do. After doing everything, this other thing decides what the outcome of the
            command was and tells the web server. The web server composes an HTTP response and
            sends that back to the browser.</p>
            
            <p>The browser breaks that into its various parts and accordingly displays a web page,
            shows an image or does whatever else was specified.</p>
            
            <h2 id="review">Review</h2>
            <p>A particular protocol might get quite complicated, but the concept of a protocol
            is quite general.
            A computer protocol is just a way that we expect things to work, and we agree on a
            computer protocol because that makes it easier for us to make computers communicate.
            “Protocol” means the same thing for computers as it does for people.</p>
