            Many important lessons are about ways of thinking rather than specific
            material. When one changes her way of thinking, things that previously
            seemed impossible can become common sense. I have been using interactive
            music and food technology to teach the concept that data can be converted
            into anything. I create seemingly impossible pieces. Then I explain to
            people how these things work and provide the software for them to create
            their own seemingly impossible pieces. By learning how the pieces work
            and by playing with the software, people learn this deeper concept that
            data can be turned into anything.

            <h1 id="on-the-use-of-a-seemingly-impossible-technology-to-teach-different-way-of-thinking">On the use of a seemingly impossible technology to teach different way of thinking</h1>
            <p>To me, it is common sense that data could be extracted from a pair
            of pants and that that data could be converted into a slice of apple pie.
            But for many people, it is not common sense.</p>
            
            <p>An understanding of this concept can change how someone thinks; things
            that previously seemed impossible become common sense after one really
            gets this concept.</p>
            
            <p>The best way I’ve found to teach this concept is to create interactive
            technology that seems impossible until you understand the new concept.</p>
            
            <p>In this article, I’ll first explain what I mean by “data” and why we
            care about data. Next, I’ll explain how I use interactive music and
            food experiences to teach the concept that we can can convert data
            into anything. There is a different approach that I use for teaching
            that anything can be converted into data, but I’ll save that explanation
            for another time.</p>
            
            <h2 id="what-data-are-and-why-we-want-them">What data are, and why we want them</h2>
            <p>People use the word “data” to mean everything, so I never really know
            what people mean when they’re talking about it. For the purposes of the
            present article, I’m considering data to be a collection of things,
            where each thing is represented in some digital, quantified, or
            structured form. I typically think of this as tables, with each column
            being a variable and each row being a different thing in the collection.</p>
            
            <p>Regardless of whether you think of this as a table, this representation
            is helpful because much of our quantitative methods expect inputs in this
            form. Once we express the world in this form, we can apply any of our
            quantitative methods (statistics, machine learning, modelling, whatever
            you want to call them) and discover things that would have been hard to
            discover without the help of math and computers.</p>
            
            <h2 id="converting-data-into-real-things">Converting data into real things</h2>
            <p>In order to teach this concept that data could be converted into anything,
            I convert data into real things while
            still conveying the complex relationships within the data.</p>
            
            <h3 id="music-videos">Music videos</h3>
            <p>We’re most known for our music videos.</p>
            
            <p>A while ago, I made a video about the gifts my true love gave to me
            on the twelve days of Christmas.</p>
            
            <iframe width="560" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/rLZDvXPIDa0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
            
            <p><a href="http://csvsoundsystem.com">csv soundsystem</a>
            is a hacker collective with many projects surrounding this theme.
            We collectively made a song about the financial crisis based on
            treasury data.</p>
            
            <p><a href="http://fms.csvsoundsystem.com"><img alt="FMS Symphony" src="fms.png" class="wide" /></a></p>
            
            <p>More recently, I made one about transit ridership in Chicago and New York.</p>
            
            <video width="100%" src="/!/ridership-rachenitsa/transit.webm"></video>
            
            <p>And here’s a show that csv soundsystem played.</p>
            
            <iframe src="//player.vimeo.com/video/76190871" width="500" height="281" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
            <p><a href="http://vimeo.com/76190871">csv soundsystem at Codame</a> from <a href="http://vimeo.com/lamthuyvo">Lam Thuy Vo</a> on <a href="https://vimeo.com">Vimeo</a>.</p>
            
            <p>When people hear this, they just think of it as music;
            it seems impossible that it could have been produced with data.
            This gives us an opportunity to explain how anything that people
            manipulate (like notes that we play on an instrument) can be
            informed by data.</p>
            
            <h3 id="data-gastronomification">Data gastronomification</h3>
            <p>We also started getting into data gastronomification, that is,
            turning data into food. Here are some
            <a href="https://twitter.com/internetrebecca/status/352955293291913217">data cookies</a>
            and some
            <a href="https://github.com/tlevine/data-guacamole">data guacamole</a></p>
            
            <p>Again, we’re just making normal food. People initially
            don’t understand how it could come from data,
            and this gives us an opportunity
            to talk about relating data to the real world.</p>
            
            <h3 id="interactivity">Interactivity</h3>
            <p>When people see a wacky thing that csv soundsystem made with data,
            they start thinking about the idea that data can be converted into
            anything. What really hammers it home is that we make tools that
            let you create your own data-driven music and gastronomifications.
            We have packages that let you compose music in
            <a href="https://github.com/csv/ddr">R</a>, and
            <a href="https://github.com/csv/ddpy">Python</a>,
            <a href="https://github.com/csv/sheetmusic">Google Spreadsheets</a>,
            and we have a package that lets you convert data into
            <a href="https://github.com/csv/gastronomify">recipes for food</a>
            (Here’s a video <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CiDW7NVa8o">a video</a> about them.)</p>
            
            <p>For people who are already comfortable with R, Python or Google
            Spreadsheets, these packages feel like any other package. Without
            knowing much about music or food, people can make their own data
            sonifications and data gastronomifications. With this power, people
            start thinking more creatively about how to convert data into
            real things rather than just graphs and tables.</p>
            
            <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
            <p>When one wants to learn about the history of a topic or the use
            of a specific tool, a typical book or class can work quite well.
            I don’t think they work as well for teaching more abstract ways
            of thinking, like the idea that data can be extracted from anything
            and that data can be turned into anything.</p>
            
            <p>Instead of teaching a normal class, I show people something that,
            at first, seems impossible. They get curious about how music could
            possibly be created from data about the federal treasury, and they
            want to know how it works. As they learn about how it works,
            they also learn the deeper concept that we can convert anything
            into data and can convert data into anything.</p>
