            <p>Fivethirtyeight and all of the talk about it is interesting, but his statistical
            model, in particular, is not. In this post,</p>

              <li>I recount the story of how I recognized this,</li>

              <li>I praise the boringness of his model and</li>
              <li>I ponder what the interest in such a boring model tells us about the world in general.</li>

            <p>If you don’t feel like reading this whole post, skip to the section at the end

            <h2 id="my-discovery-of-nate-silver">My discovery of Nate Silver</h2>
            <p>My discovery of Nate Silver is sort of hilarious.</p>
            
            <p>I first learned of Nate Silver and fivethirtyeight a few days ago from a
            <a href="https://twitter.com/tswicegood/status/265077206223556608">tweet by Travis Swicegood</a>
            referencing
            <a href="http://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2012/11/a-bet-is-a-tax-on-bullshit.html">an article by Alex Tabarrok</a>.
            Before that, I hadn’t ever heard of Nate Silver or his blog. And after reading that,
            I still didn’t realize that Nate Silver was so well-known or that the blog was published
            in the New York Times.</p>
            
            <p>The article discussed the practical meaning of Nate Silver’s probabilities but didn’t
            go in to how these probabilities are computed. I figured that they must be computed
            from some crazy Bayesian model that relates newly released data to data from past
            elections; to say it less technically, I figured it must be some fancy new model.
            Because I thought it was such complex nonsense, I figured it was probably wrong.</p>
            
            <h2 id="recognition-of-nate-silver-as-a-pop-culture-phenomenon">Recognition of Nate Silver as a pop culture phenomenon.</h2>
            <p>I recognized over the next few days through various conversations that people see
            Nate Silver’s model as some crazy awesome new technology and that all of the straight
            girls want to have his babies.</p>
            
            <p>I also finally figured out (The <a href="">Wikipedia article</a>
            was informative.) that it was a blog on the New York Times, so I read some
            of it. Most of his statistics/graphs/tables make sense to me, but I didn’t understand
            why the graphs at the top of prediction over time change when you switch between the 
            forecast and the nowcast. (And I still don’t, so please tell me if you know.)</p>
            
            <p>But I still didn’t understand his model at all; how did he arrived at his predictions?</p>
            
            <h2 id="figuring-out-the-model">Figuring out the model</h2>
            
            <p>After soliciting some explanations <a href="">on Twitter</a>
            and reading about Nate Silver <a href="">on the NICAR list</a>,
            I finally realized that fivethirtyeight’s model had been making loads of correct
            predictions for the past few years. I also realized that the model was kind of simple
            but was hyped up to sound more complex than it was.</p>
            
            <p>At its core, Nate Silver’s model is simple aggregation of polls that ask which candidate
            people plan to vote for. The simulation part can be seen as an approximation of the
            probability that you supposedly learned in middle school. He apparently does some
            slightly fancier things to combine polls from different companies over time, and he uses
            some demographic data.</p>
            
            <h2 id="merits-of-such-simplicity">Merits of such simplicity</h2>
            
            <h2 id="why-are-people-so-excited-about-nate-silvers-model">Why are people so excited about Nate Silver’s model?</h2>
            
            <p>There are loads of reasons why you might love Nate Silver’s blog. For example, it is
            quite wonderful that everyone can have access to such easy-to-read, visual
            presentations; any old person can take a look and get an idea of what’s going on,
            and that is valuable. People also see this as a victory for science or statistics;
            it demonstrates that numbers and thought might sometimes be right. (Without the
            weasel-words, I would see that last sentence as non-scientific.)</p>
            
            <p>But some people are excited specifically by the model. As I explain above, it is not
            mathematically interesting, so why are people interested?</p>
            
            <ol>
              <li>Simple models are often more accurate and easier to explain.
             (See “Merits of such simplicity”.)</li>
              <li>The New York Times talked about this model as if it was some fancy new technology.
             (See “Figuring out the model”.)</li>
              <li>People don’t realize how simple the model is.</li>
