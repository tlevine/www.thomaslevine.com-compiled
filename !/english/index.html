<article><p>While in England (mostly Liverpool), I composed a list of translations between
English and American. I group them into four categories</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Vocabulary</strong> contains drop-in replacements.</li>
  <li><strong>Equivalents</strong> are concepts that do not exist in both languages/places
    but are systematically similar.</li>
  <li><strong>Grammar</strong> contains differences that affect to syntax, tense, &amp;c.
    or that depend strongly on context.</li>
  <li><strong>English-only</strong> are phrases that exist in English for which I haven’t
    found an American equivalent with a matching connotation.</li>
</ol>

<p>I present the first two in tables and the latter two in lists. See the
“Table Formatting” section at the end for documentation of the tables’ formatting.</p>

<h2 id="grammar">Grammar</h2>

<h3 id="collections">Collections</h3>
<p>Nouns that describe collections are plural in English</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The organization are interesting.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>and singular in American.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The organization is interesting.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="sitting">Sitting</h3>
<p>Descriptions of seated people take different adjective forms. In English,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The people are sat.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In American,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The people are sitting.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="equivalents">Equivalents</h2>
<p>Where you go for a proverbial drink: In England, you go to a <strong>pub</strong>, and in
America, you go to a <strong>bar</strong>. But they’re different things, and both exist in both
countries. In particular, you would only go to a bar for a drink, but you might
go to a pub for only food.</p>

<p>The hypothetical disgusting fast food establishment that you would never go to
is the <strong>kebab shop</strong> in England or the <strong>McDonalds</strong> in America.</p>

<p>The canonical cheap food in America is pizza. In England, it might be a
<strong>kebab</strong> or anything from a <strong>chippy</strong>, which might not be much different
from a kebab shop.</p>

<p>The big meal you proverbially have on Sunday around noon is a <strong>roast</strong> in
England or a <strong>brunch</strong> in America. Brunch also exists in England, but it’s
not the thing that you talk about and see written on restaurant signs. You
can read elsewhere about Sunday roasts and Sunday brunches.</p>

<p>The English word <strong>parcel</strong> is similar to the American word <strong>package</strong>, but
I don’t remember the particular similarity.</p>

<p>Stereotypes of the <strong>North</strong> of England are like those of the <strong>South</strong> of the
United States; the regions are seen as having less happening, and the
respective accents are seen as vulgar.</p>

<p>The minor currencies in England and America are pence and cents, respectively. In
everyday speech, a candy might cost 20 “p” in England or 35 “cents” in America.</p>

<p>An English duvet is the same thing as an American comforter, but the word is
less unusual; the word <strong>duvet</strong> is used in English where the word <strong>blacket</strong>
would be used in American.</p>

<!-- Check this one.
In American, lists must contain the word "and". In English, they do not need the
word "or". For example, the following phrase is appropriate in English but not
in American: "
-->

<h2 id="english-only">English-only</h2>
<p>You should see this table as definitions of English phrases rather than
translations; the connotation in the American column doesn’t match the one
in the English column.</p>

<pre><code>English                     American
-------------------------   -------------------------
other half                  significant other
brilliant                   great! wonderful!
fortnight                   two weeks
zebra crossing              specific type of crosswalk
pelican crossing            specific type of crosswalk
</code></pre>

<h2 id="other-things">Other things</h2>

<h3 id="measurement">Measurement</h3>
<p>I noted a difference in measurement that didn’t fit in my other categories.</p>

<p>Different measurements units are used in each country. In England, metric is
normally seen as the standard, but in America, a subset of the imperial units
are seen as standard.</p>

<p>In both countries, certain imperial units are used specifically for specific
purposes. Some examples follow.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Bushel</strong> in American (maybe English too) for measuring farm produce</li>
  <li><strong>Stone</strong> in English for measuring body weight</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="table-formatting">Table formatting</h3>
<p>The Vocabulary and Equivalents are presented in tables formatted thusly.</p>

<p>Words in <strong>parentheses</strong> are optional; I include them for context or because the
phrase can be used with or without particular words</p>

<p>If a few different phrases from one country seem about right and I can’t decide
which to use, (This is normally for American phrases.) I separate the different
phrases with commas.</p>

<p>If parts of speech are not obvious, the word is preceded by the abbreviated part
of speech and a colon</p></article>
