            <h1>The mindset of data science</h1>
            <p>I proclaim that “data science” isn’t about specific tools or datasets
            or math; rather, it’s a mindset.<sup id="fnref:mindset"><a href="#fn:mindset" class="footnote">1</a></sup></p>
            
            <h2 id="motivation">Motivation</h2>
            <p>I normally find the phrase “data science” to be too meaningless to be
            worth using, but I recently needed to figure out what it meant.</p>
            
            <h3 id="why-i-resisted-defining-data-science">Why I resisted defining data science</h3>
            <p>I’ve been resisting using and defining the term “data science”.
            Such words make me cringe for two main reasons.</p>
            
            <ol>
              <li>I don’t like words in general, especially nouns; they are too
             simplifying, so you need a lot of them to convey much meaning.</li>
              <li>People want to be doing sexy things like data science, so everyone
             says he’s a data scientist, and this makes the word more meaningless.</li>
            </ol>
            
            <p>These problems aren’t at all specific to data science; it’s the same
            with any sexy field.</p>
            
            <h3 id="why-i-define-it-now">Why I define it now</h3>
            <p>Recently, many people have suggested that I teach data science.
            That sounded fun, but teaching data science involves defining it
            enough that I can teach it, so now I give in and define it.</p>
            
            <p>People are still going to use data science to mean whatever they want, but
            there is a newly useful approach to quantitative research that comes up in
            a lot of settings, and I suppose we could call that “data science”.</p>
            
            <h2 id="the-mindset">The mindset</h2>
            <p>I see data science as this mindset:</p>
            
            <blockquote>
              <p>I want to study how the world works.
            Also, computing power and storage are cheap.
            So I’m going to exploit the cheap computers to study how the world works.</p>
            </blockquote>
            
            <p>This is also my mindset. I’m going to talk about all of the corollaries that
            stem from my mindset, and I guess we’ll say that that’s data science.</p>
            
            <h3 id="store-everything">Store everything</h3>
            <p>Storage is cheap, so you should store everything that is easy to collect.
            Store it in the most raw form that is convenient, and don’t worry very
            much about how or even whether you’re going to analyze it.</p>
            
            <h3 id="anything-can-be-quantified">Anything can be quantified</h3>
            <p>Everything can be turned into a number, and these numbers can be put in tables.
            By quantifying things, we simplify them such that a computer can process them.</p>
            
            <p>To me, there is no big difference between “qualitative” and “quantitative” data
            nor between “unstructured” and “structured” data because I know that I can convert
            between these opposites.</p>
            
            <p>Read more about this <a href="/!/world-data-world">here</a>.</p>
            
            <h3 id="boring-work-should-be-sent-to-robots">Boring work should be sent to robots</h3>
            <p>In general, I think that people should only do things that they want to do;
            if something must be done and nobody wants to do it, a robot should do it[^robot]
            I could come up with economic arguments for this, but this is almost an ethical view for me.</p>
            
            <p>Within the context of data analysis, there are some much more practical reasons
            for this. A typical boring task might be drawing a new graph every time some
            dataset is updated. A robot will do this with substantially more
            consistency/accuracy and for a substantially lower cost.</p>
            
            <p>So here are some mindsets that follow from the aforementioned data science mindset.</p>
            
            <ul>
              <li>Data collection should be automatic and unobtrusive; questionnaires and lab
              studies are too much work.</li>
              <li>I don’t need a full-fleged research plan before you start collecting data;
              I’ll record everything that is convenient, and I’ll store it in the most raw form.</li>
              <li>All analyses should be scripted.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>To say this more explosively, I value laziness.</p>
            
            <h3 id="focus-on-connecting-datasets-rather-than-on-tuning-models">Focus on connecting datasets rather than on tuning models</h3>
            <p>In a conventional statistics class, you’ll learn a lot about how to choose
            analysis methods that are appropriate for your data collection approach and how
            to tune the models for a specific dataset. That way of thinking is not new.</p>
            
            <p>Here’s the new thing. Now that we have hoards of inexpensive data, it’s not
            worth worrying so much about making the best use out of one dataset; it’s better
            to use a range of datasets, and especially to connect one dataset to lots of
            other datasets. To use machine learning speak, you should focus more on collecting
            features rather than on tuning your model.</p>
            
            <p>Relating this to the earlier point that you should store everything, here are
            some of my mindsets that follow from the original mindset.</p>
            
            <ul>
              <li>When I’m asked a question about the world, I adapt the question so that it can
              be approximately answered with an existing and convenient dataset.</li>
              <li>I look for opportunities to use existing stores of data in unintended ways.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h2 id="tools">Tools</h2>
            <p>Since I have the aforementioned mindset and the consequential mindsets, I wind
            up learning a bunch of tools that align with that mindset. For example, I know
            how to collect lots of data continuously, how to store it, how to get it out of
            storage, how to have a computer analyze datasets that I can’t fit in my head,
            how to convert paper documents into data tables, how to get the computer to tell
            me something that I and other people understand, and how to make all of this run
            fast enough that I don’t get tired of waiting.</p>
            
            <p>Properly discussing these relevant tools would take a while, but here’s a small
            thought: You don’t need to know much math to do data science. Loads of wonderful
            algorithms have already been implemented for you, and simple algorithms work quite
            well. The more important tools are “plumbing” that connects different datasets and systems.</p>
            
            <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
            
            <ul>
              <li>
                <p>How to learn data science:
            I see data science as a mindset that we should use inexpensive computers
            to understand how the world works. I wind up learning specific programs,
            languages, models, &amp;c. to assist in my study of the world, but y</p>
