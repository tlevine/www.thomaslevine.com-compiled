          <article>
            <p>I&#8217;ve recently been around several people who have been teaching data science in
            various ways. I&#8217;ve always been skeptical of the utility of the educational
            &#8220;data science&#8221; that I&#8217;ve seen, but that might be because I&#8217;m always skeptical
            of schooling and of anything termed &#8220;data science&#8221;. Or maybe I&#8217;m just skeptical
            of everything. My distaste for the buzzterms tends to relate largely to the
            semantic ambiguity of the terms, but the various related concepts tend to be
            meaningful and appealing, so it is worth defining and teaching them. My
            conclusion from this ramble on the utility of teaching the nebulous concept of
            &#8220;data science&#8221; was that it would be nice to figure out what data science
            involves and how I would teach it.</p>
            
            <p>The only data science course syllabus that I recall reading is the one from
            General Assebly in New York, and I haven&#8217;t read any books with &#8220;data science&#8221;
            in the title. After I write all this, it&#8217;ll be fun to compare this with what
            other people think should be taught.</p>
            
            <h2 id="the-mindset">The mindset</h2>
            <p>First, I see data science as a mindset. I also see ergonomics (another thing
            I apparently know a lot about) as a mindset, so it might just be that everything
            becomes a mindset once you get good at it. Here are some main aspects of this
            mindset.</p>
            
            <ol>
              <li>It is fun to learn how complex systems work and to apply the resulting
             knowledge, and quantitative information can assist in this fun.</li>
              <li>Everything can be turned into a number.</li>
              <li>It is rude and statistically unsound to ask people questions that will only
             be used for study.
                <ul>
                  <li>It is better to surveille people unobtrusobly (like by watching security
              cameras or reading web server logs) or to use questions that they have
              other reason to answer (like by reading credit card purchases or
              Tweets).</li>
                  <li>I actually don&#8217;t see those two approaches as different; it&#8217;s more like
              they&#8217;re different ways of saying the same thing.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>As a corallary to the previous point, if collecting data on complex behaviors
             is convenient/inexpensive, you should collect the data even if you have no
             plans to use them. For example, if you make a website that starts getting
             much traffic, you should log every interaction that you can conveniently
             log, or at least every HTTP request that is made.</li>
              <li>When asked a question about the world, adapt the question so that it can be
             answered with an existing and convenient dataset.</li>
            </ol>
            
            <p>I think these points stem from a desire to learn how complex systems work.
            If you want to do that and you are alive today, you might get excited by the
            potential off the ease of collecting and storing quantitative information,
            and the aspects above follow logically.</p>
            
            <h2 id="specific-lessons">Specific lessons</h2>
            <p>If I were to teach data science, I would teach things that are obvious
            consequences of the above mindset. That is, I would expose and reinforce
            the above mindset, and I would teach methods that allow people to embody
            the above mindset.</p>
            
            <p>The course would generally follow this schedule, with a few lessons per item.</p>
            
            <ol>
              <li>The data mindset</li>
              <li>Converting a mess into data</li>
              <li>Stuff you can do once you have data.
                <ul>
                  <li>Graphs</li>
                  <li>Interactives</li>
                  <li>Statistics and predictions</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ol>
            
            <p>The numbered points would go in order, but the different stuff that you do
            once you have data could be ordered quite flexibly. I would want students to
            be learning that stuff only after they have a unique dataset to try them on.</p>
            
            <p>The following sections are these various topics, grouped into lessons
            and ordered in the order I would give them. (But if a lesson is titled
            &#8220;Lesson XXX&#8221;, I haven&#8217;t figured out where it goes yet.)</p>
            
            <h3 id="but-first-some-small-notes">But first, some small notes</h3>
            <p>I happen to mention R libraries for most things, but I actually think
            people should be using some other language. Python (pandas) and Scala
            (Saddle) seem better because they&#8217;re faster. I wouldn&#8217;t really care what
            students use.</p>
            
            <p>One point I want to get across is that <strong>you</strong> can do data science too.
            I don&#8217;t mention many buzzwords in the following descriptions, but I
            would define them as they come up and briefly rant about how they&#8217;re
            not usually much more meaningful than ordinary words.</p>
            
            <h3 id="lesson-1-everything-can-be-quantified">Lesson 1: Everything can be quantified</h3>
            <p>I would break down distinctions between qualitative information and
            quantitative information and distinctions between unstructured and structured
            data.</p>
            
            <p>I would discuss what people mean by &#8220;qualitative&#8221; and &#8220;quantitative&#8221;
            information, what they mean by &#8220;unstructured&#8221; and &#8220;structured&#8221; data, and how
            people can convert between these opposites.</p>
            
            <p>I would model flows of information through a bureaucracy and show
            how that could be gradually converted to computer program. (If you&#8217;ve
            seen me give a talk in the last year, I&#8217;ve probably done something like
            this with an example of the review of permits to dredge or fill wetlands.)</p>
            
            <p>I would have students write some small program that converts some
            inconvenient data source into a table that would produce an interesting
            plot.</p>
            
            <h3 id="lesson-xxx-tidy-data">Lesson XXX: Tidy data</h3>
            <p>I would say that &#8220;data&#8221; means &#8220;table&#8221; to me. And if you&#8217;re doing
            calculations on a non-relational database, you&#8217;re approximating a table;
            the non-relational structure is just an implementation detail.</p>
            
            <p>I would talk about the concept and merits of tidyness and about how you
            can achieve this with <code>plyr</code> and <code>reshape2</code>. I&#8217;d discuss some theory and
            language that is embodied in the two libraries.</p>
            
            <p>I&#8217;d have students tidy a dataset to the point that they can grammatically
            plot it or run a regression or whatnot.</p>
            
            <h3 id="lesson-xxx-data-storage">Lesson XXX: Data storage</h3>
            <p>Data is a table, but you can store it in a lot of ways.</p>
            
            <p>I&#8217;ll also talk about how data stores can be used as interfaces between
            languages.</p>
            
            <p>A toy project could involve querying a JSON API, loading that into a
            fancy database, querying that database, maybe serializing the output
            as CSV, and then doing something pretty with the resulting data.</p>
            
            <h3 id="lesson-xxx-development-practices">Lesson XXX: Development practices</h3>
            <p>This stuff will be quite helpful in the projects, and people don&#8217;t usually
            teach this in school. Students don&#8217;t have to follow these processes
            diligently, but it&#8217;s nice to know about them.</p>
            
            <ul>
              <li>Test-driven development</li>
              <li>Documentation-driven development</li>
              <li>Behavior-driven development</li>
              <li>Agile</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>I&#8217;d want to read more about these too.</p>
            
            <h3 id="lesson-xxx-the-shell-and-dotfiles">Lesson XXX: The shell and dotfiles</h3>
            <p>I would talk about some shell concepts.</p>
            
            <ul>
              <li>Pipes</li>
              <li>Directing output</li>
              <li>STDIN, STDOUT, STDERR</li>
              <li><code>#!</code></li>
              <li><code>$PATH</code></li>
              <li>Access environment variables from other languages</li>
              <li><code>set -e</code></li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>I&#8217;d also talk about some useful specific programs.</p>
            
            <p>I would have students write a shell script that ties together some things
            we&#8217;ve already done. And I&#8217;d encourage students play with vim or emacs and
            git if they aren&#8217;t already.</p>
            
            <h3 id="lesson-xxx-querying-data-stores">Lesson XXX: Querying data stores</h3>
            <p>I would discuss a few general paradigms</p>
            
            <ul>
              <li>Filesystem</li>
              <li>MapReduce</li>
              <li>SQL and variants</li>
              <li>ReST</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3 id="lesson-xxx-performance-concerns">Lesson XXX: Performance concerns</h3>
            <p>When data gets more than tiny, you have to think about RAM, storage,
            speed, &amp;c. I would discuss how this stuff comes up and how you can
            deal with it.</p>
            
            <p>I&#8217;d rather not assign any practical work that involves dealing with
            more than a few gigabytes of data; it would take a while, and the
            result wouldn&#8217;t be that interesting. But some smaller-scale things
            would be fun for students who haven&#8217;t dealt them.</p>
            
            <ul>
              <li>Extract some bits of information from a shit ton of huge files
              without using much memory at once.</li>
              <li>Optimize some code in a dynamic language by calling C. For example,
              in R, you might vectorize the code or use Rcpp.</li>
              <li>Randomly sample a dataset.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3 id="lesson-xxx-visual-displays-of-quantitative-information">Lesson XXX: Visual displays of quantitative information</h3>
            <p>I would talk about different kinds of plots and how they relate to types
            of variables. I read an awesome book by Bill Clevelend in the Cornell
            Math Library that categoriezed plots based on the types of input data.</p>
            
            <p>I would talk about some of Edward Tufte&#8217;s principles, and I would have
            people draw graphs on paper that embody some of his principles. The main
            ones that I think about day to day are below, but I might add others, and
            I might also look at other recommendations regarding visual displays.</p>
            
            <ul>
              <li>Data:ink ratio</li>
              <li>Multidimensionality</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>There might also be some general graphic design things. I quite like
            <em>Design Elements</em>, by Timothy Samara.</p>
            
            <h3 id="lesson-xxx-quantifying-the-real-world">Lesson XXX: Quantifying the real world</h3>
            <p>I would teach people enough about microcontrollers that they would be able
            to hook up a sensor to an Arduino and send the sensings to some safe place.</p>
            
            <p>As a project, students could select a sensor, put it in a breadboard,
            connect it to an Arduino, write some program, leave it somewhere for a
            week, and make a plot. For added fun, they could assemble a Boarduino,
            solder it to a breadboard and solder the sensor to it.</p>
            
            <p>I feel like this project and lesson should be optional.</p>
            
            <h3 id="lesson-xxx-grammar-of-graphics">Lesson XXX: Grammar of graphics</h3>
            <p>When exploring data, producing mundane visuals or planning complex visuals,
            I find the grammar of graphics to be quite helpful. I would explain the
            concepts, show examples in <code>ggplot2</code> or <code>d3</code>, and have students make plots
            that slice a complex dataset in <code>ggplot2</code> or <code>d3</code>.</p>
            
            <h3 id="lesson-xxx-storytelling-and-interactivity">Lesson XXX: Storytelling and interactivity</h3>
            <p>People in journalism talk about telling stories with data to make things
            more real. I&#8217;d pick from my talk on interactive data from Kelton&#8217;s
            symposium.</p>
            
            <p>If students don&#8217;t know much about web development, there could be a basic
            project where students are given a data source with a convenient web API
            and they make a website that displays the data in a way that lets people
            find their own stories.</p>
            
            <h3 id="lesson-a-web-scraping">Lesson a: Web Scraping</h3>
            <p>It&#8217;s sort of hard to avoid this series if I&#8217;m teaching. I would do
            something akin to my talks at the ScraperWiki data camps; I would show
            how to diagram a website, make GET requests and parse the HTML. I would
            use a website that had one page involving a messy HTTP request, and I
            would skip that for now.</p>
            
            <h3 id="lesson-a--1-http">Lesson a + 1: HTTP</h3>
            <p>I would discuss the components of an HTTP request, talk about the ReST
            thing, show how to use some web APIs, and show how to build up a web
            request that matches the one your web browser made. I would finish the
            part of the site from the web scraping lesson that involved the messy
            HTTP request.</p>
            
            <h3 id="lessons-xxx-statistics-machine-learning-c">Lessons XXX: Statistics, machine learning, &amp;c.</h3>
            <p>I think it&#8217;s too easy for people to talk more than is helpful about
            statistics or machine learning. I don&#8217;t know how many lessons I would
            devote to this, but here are some things that would get discussed</p>
            
            <ul>
              <li>Fundamental statistical concepts like mean and variance</li>
              <li>Emphasizing prediction versus inference, which I see as the main
              distinction between machine learning and statistics</li>
              <li>Categorizing algorithms
                <ul>
                  <li>Unsupervised versus supervised</li>
                  <li>Type signature (like this: one discrete variables ~ many continuous variables)</li>
                  <li>Frequentist versus Bayesian</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>A project could involve computing some quantity or building some model
            based on some data that students already have.</p>
            
            <h2 id="specific-projects">Specific projects</h2>
            <p>Preferably, there wouldn&#8217;t be much of me standing in a room giving formal
            lessons; there would be more of people working on related projects with
            my help. People would work on complex projects that interest them.</p>
            
            <p>Creation of any reasonably complex data project should help convince
            an employer to employ someone as a data scientist, but if people are
            particularly concerned for their employability, I could make sure that
            projects hit a few skill sets that would be relevant for their desired
            employment.</p>
            
            <p>If people can&#8217;t come up with an idea, I would seed their thoughts with</p>
            
            <ol>
              <li>the various projects that I&#8217;ve started and maybe collected data for</li>
              <li>studies of their personal information, like emails, chat logs,
             activity on websites, &amp;c.</li>
              <li>projects of relevance to their work or to a non-profit organization</li>
            </ol>
            
            <p>Depending on the length of the course, it might be one or three projects
            that embody the data science mindset and use some skills that were discussed.
            Here follow some components of these projects</p>
            
            <h3 id="mess-to-numbers">Mess to numbers</h3>
            <p>The project should convert a mess of information into at least one
            tidy table. (This table might not be exposed directly to consumers of
            the project.)</p>
            
            <p>The mess could be the real world, collected with sensors or a
            previously-digitized repository, like book scans.</p>
            
            <h3 id="answer-a-question">Answer a question</h3>
            <p>The project should answer a question. This could be one specific
            question, like &#8220;which copy should we use on the product&#8221;, but it could
            also be a class of questions that consumers of the project might ask,
            like &#8220;which hair stylist should I choose&#8221;.</p>
            
            <h3 id="teaching">Teaching</h3>
            <p>The project should explain how it works to people with no knowledge of
            data science. That is, the math and software should be explained in
            simple or simplified terms and related to the question(s) at hand.</p>
            
            <p>Visuals (or some other high-dimensional data presentation format) should
            be present and explained.</p>
            
            <h3 id="web">Web</h3>
            <p>The project should be explained as a website. Minimally, this could be
            just a Tumblr blog post about an analysis, but it would be more cool if
            interactions and animations can be used to add more dimensions of data
            or to make a story that is more relevant to the particular viewer.</p>
            
            <ul>
              <li>Automatic compilation of the website (with knitr, for example)</li>
              <li>Writing of some HTML, CSS, Javascript, &amp;c.</li>
              <li>Sexy moving visuals and whatnot</li>
              <li>Website automatically updates with new data from a data feed.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>This is partly for my convenience, but it&#8217;s mainly because it&#8217;s worth
            learning these webby things and because I&#8217;d be able to teach them.</p>
            
            <h3 id="selling-the-data-mindset">Selling the data mindset</h3>
            <p>It&#8217;s cool if the project can get people thinking more about how they
            can use the data science mindset for related things. For example, if
            someone assembled a dataset of preferred olive oils and related it
            to personality types, it might be fun to comment on what other data
            could be collected about olive oils or about what would happen if we
            combined the dataset with a dataset about the olive farms and their
            weather.</p>
            
            <p>This sort of commentary is most appropriate for projects where the
            student worked closely with a specific client organization or where
            the project is related to the student&#8217;s own work.</p>
            
            <h3 id="live">Live</h3>
            <p>Students should present their projects in person because that&#8217;s fun.
            Maybe they get like five minutes each because I get bored of long
            presentations.</p>
            
            <h2 id="general-relationship-to-existing-fields">General relationship to existing fields</h2>
            <p>People with data science mindset want to start studying things in certain
            ways, so they wind up deciding to learn certain sorts of things. At a high
            level, the following doodle explains those things.</p>
            
            <p><img src="/!/teaching-data-science/data-people.png" alt="Plot of the four professions' abilities with analysis and abilities with computers" /></p>
            
            <p>Data scientists know both how to learn things from numbers (analysis skills)
            and how to turn things into numbers (computer skills).</p>
            
            <h3 id="not-domain-knowledge">Not domain knowledge</h3>
            <p>Drew Conway says that domain knowledge is also part of the data science thing,
            but I don&#8217;t like including that. Here are few reasons why.</p>
            
            <h4 id="domain-knowledge-is-good-for-everyone">1. Domain knowledge is good for everyone.</h4>
            <p>It&#8217;s probably good for anyone working in a particular area to know about
            that area. For example, analysts need to know the area so they can analyze
            it, statisticians need to know the area so they can specify appropriate
            models and write good reports, and engineers need to understand how their
            users use things. So domain expertise doesn&#8217;t distinguish data scientists
            from anyone else.</p>
            
            <h4 id="domain-knowledge-is-seen-as-the-role-of-the-analyst-or-the-academic">2. Domain knowledge is seen as the role of the analyst or the academic</h4>
            <p>In contemporary organizations and society, domain knowledge appears to be
            the role of the analyst or the academic. With experience, the
            analyst/academic learns a lot about a particular domain, whereas other role
            get better at other things that can be applied to different domains.</p>
            
            <h4 id="the-data-science-mindset-is-about-learning-and-teaching">3. The data science mindset is about learning and teaching</h4>
            <p>The data science mindset is about the using digital quantitative
            information to learn how complex systems work and to convey this
            knowledge to others; the specific manner of system isn&#8217;t part of the
            mindset.</p>
            
            <h4 id="what-is-a-domain-anyway">4. What is a domain anyway?</h4>
            <p>When I&#8217;m with a group of people who don&#8217;t know computer stuff know that
            computers could help their organization do stuff better, maybe I&#8217;m acting
            as an expert in the domain of data science.</p>
