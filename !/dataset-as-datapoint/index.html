            <!-- For the winter issue of Socrata's magazine -->
            <p>I’ve recently been collecting and studying
            <a href="/open-data">data about open data</a>.</p>
            
            <p>The key insight that makes this possible
            and relevance
            metrics</p>
            
            <h2 id="data-set-as-data-point">Data set as data point</h2>
            <p>The inspiration for all of these studies is the idea that
            any collection of things could be seen as data to be analyzed.</p>
            
            <p>Specifically, even a collection of datasets could be treated
            as a dataset of datasets, with a record for each particular
            dataset.</p>
            
            <h2 id="metadata-as-data">Metadata as data</h2>
            <p>The term “metadata” is sort of funny. Metadata are data about
            data, but they’re still data, so do we really need another term
            for it? In studying metadata about 100,000 datasets, I started
            to see what it means. When people talk about “metadata”, they’re
            usually thinking of information that you’d use for cataloging
            and framing the data rather than stuff that you would do “data
            analysis” on. Of course, it doesn’t have to be this way.</p>
            
            <p>When we see datasets as data points, we see metadata as data.
            Inside of our collection of datasets, we have a record for each
            sub-dataset; and inside each record, we have a bunch of
            fields/attributes/variables/features about the dataset. What fields
            should go in there? The metadata fields are a pretty good place
            to start.</p>
            
            <h2 id="creating-new-fields-in-our-dataset-of-datasets">Creating new fields in our dataset of datasets</h2>
            <p>Another thing about metadata is that they are usually recorded
            separately of the data. For example, the title of a dataset will
            probably be in the metadata, but the number of rows in the dataset
            might not be. This shouldn’t stop us from from counting how many
            rows each sub-dataset has and putting that in our dataset-of-datasets.</p>
            
            <p>Don’t get me wrong; there is much to be learned by studying the
            metadata alone. In a <a href="/!/socrata-formats">couple</a>
            <a href="/!/socrata-deduplicate">cases</a>, I used data straight from
            Socrata’s <a href="">DCAT</a> endpoint,
            which only includes some minimal metadata.</p>
            
            <p>I’m still at the early stages of computing new fields to describe
            the different sub-datasets in our dataset-of-datasets, but some
            interesting things are already coming out of this approach.</p>
            
            <p>In many cases, I treated the names of the columns as a field.
            Thus, for each sub-dataset in the dataset of datasets, I had
            fields relating to the names and data types of different columns.
            I also treated the number of rows as a field. In concert, these
            fields allowed me to find <a href="http://appgen.me/audit/report">similar datasets</a>,
            <a href="/!/socrata-summary">large datasets</a> and
            <a href="/!/socrata-genealogies">changes to datasets</a>.</p>
            
            <h2 id="why-this-matters">Why this matters</h2>
            <p>By treating datasets as datapoints, treating metadata as data
            and creating of new attributes to describe datasets, I am able
            to conduct all of these studies about open data. But why should
            anyone else treat open data this way? I believe that thinking
            of datasets as datapoints will lead to lots of useful things.
            For now, I’ll talk about two things: searching for datasets,
            measuring data portal usage.</p>
            
            <h3 id="searching-for-datasets">Searching for datasets</h3>
            <p>Part of the goal of a data catalog is to make it easier to find
            datasets, so that we don’t need to ask someone where to find them.
            Data portal software lets us search the catalogs, but the search
            typically isn’t very helpful. On all of the data portals I’ve
            looked at, the text search is just an ordinary text search on the
            metadata and, in some cases, the full dataset. We can do better.</p>
            
            <p>Datasets are highly structured, and we can use that to make the
            search better.  Let’s say we have a dataset containing a post code
            column and we search for “crimes in Shoreditch”. The dataset might
            not actually say “Shoreditch” anywhere because it just has post
            codes, but we should be able to find the dataset.</p>
            
            <p>If we’re thinking about datasets and data points, this is sort of
            natural; here’s a crude version. We get a list of all of the names
            of neighborhoods in London. We look at each dataset, determine
            the dataset contains data about each neighborhood, and assign a
            value of yes or no for each of these neighborhoods. Since we’re
            thinking of the dataset as a row in a data table, we’re just adding
            a bunch of columns to the data table. With these richer table, we
            can improve our search feature.</p>
            
            <h3 id="data-portal-usage">Data portal usage</h3>
            <p>We often use the number of datasets on a portal as a measure of
            data portal quality. Unfortunately, this number isn’t very meaningful.</p>
            
            <p>Depending on the situation, it could make sense to break up a
            larger dataset or to combine a bunch of smaller datasets.
            Neither of these manipulations really changes the amount of data
            on the portal, but they will substantially impact our metric
            (number of datasets on the portal). Thus, this isn’t a particularly
            informative metric. Moreover, such a metric may encourage us to
            break up a larger dataset into pieces when it doesn’t really
            make sense to.</p>
            
            <p>We can develop a better metric for the amount of data on a portal,
            but we should also come up with measures for the other things that
            we really care about. Here are some examples.</p>
            
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Completeness</strong>: What proportion of a government’s data has been
              released on the portal?</li>
              <li><strong>User groups</strong>: Does the dataset tend to be used by people inside
              of government or outside of government? What proportion of dowloads
              come from government buildings?</li>
              <li><strong>Timeliness</strong>: How up-to-date are the data? How many datasets
              that were published more than a year ago have been updated within
              the past year?</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>If we think of datasets as data points, it is natural for us to
            get creative about the data that we collect about each dataset.</p>
            
            <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
            <p>Open data portals make it easier to consume data once someone
            has decided to publish them, but they don’t yet give us the
            bigger picture of what’s going on inside an open data initiative.
            We can’t really tell what datasets are available, who’s using them,
            what impact they’re having, or whether they are of good quality.</p>
            
            <p>We need to give data publishers and data consumers a better picture
            of what is going on in open data portals. I don’t know how we’ll do
            that, but I think we’ll get somewhere if we start thinking of datasets
            as datapoints.</p>
