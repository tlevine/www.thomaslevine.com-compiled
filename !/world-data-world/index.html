            <p>To me, it is common sense that data could be extracted from a pair
            of pants and that that data could be converted into a slice of apple pie.
            But for many people, it is not common sense.</p>
            
            <p>An understanding of this concept can change how someone thinks; things
            that previously seemed impossible become common sense after one really
            gets this concept.</p>
            
            <p>The best way I’ve found to teach this concept is to create interactive
            technology that seems impossible until you understand the new concept.</p>
            
            <p>I break this article into three major sections.</p>
            
            <ol>
              <li>What I mean by “data”, and why we want them</li>
              <li>How to teach that we can extract data from anything</li>
              <li>How to teach that we can convert data into anything</li>
            </ol>
            
            <h2 id="what-data-are-and-why-we-want-them">What data are, and why we want them</h2>
            <p>People use the word “data” to mean everything, so I never really know
            what people mean when they’re talking about it. For the purposes of the
            present article, I’m considering data to be a collection of things,
            where each thing is represented in some digital, quantified, or
            structured form. I typically think of this as tables, with each column
            being a variable and each row being a different thing in the collection.</p>
            
            <p>Regardless of whether you think of this as a table, this representation
            is helpful because much of our quantitative methods expect inputs in this
            form. Once we express the world in this form, we can apply any of our
            quantitative methods (statistics, machine learning, modelling, whatever
            you want to call them) and discover things that would have been hard to
            discover without the help of math and computers.</p>
            
            <h2 id="world---data-we-can-extract-data-from-anything">World -&gt; Data: We can extract data from anything</h2>
            <p>We can collect information from the world and convert it into data.
            This tends to come to people more easily. The main point here is to
            recognize that people already do things like this, though the result
            is not always so precise and concrete as a dataset. I teach this
            step of data extraction by gradually switching human processes to
            digital, data-based processes.</p>
            
            <p>The main point that I try to convey is that computers are not magical
            and you can get them to do anything that a group of people could do.
            Anything is possible if you can articulate it clearly enough.</p>
            
            <h3 id="architecture">Architecture</h3>
            <p>When people ask me to teach web scraping,
            they expect me to tell them what Python code to write to pull the
            numbers out of the web page. If I have time, I get to that, but I
            start by breaking down the process by which a human would collect the
            data.</p>
            
            <p>It’s best to do this with a process that the learners already
            know well, especially if they already want to convert it to a more
            automated process. But if the students don’t have a good example, I use
            <a href="https://github.com/tlevine/scott">Scott</a>, my wetlands permit application
            monitoring system.</p>
            
            <p>We walk through it as a human process and draw a diagram.
            In the case of Scott, the resulting diagram looks like this.</p>
            
            <blockquote>
              <p>If you are reading this, tell me to add the diagram.</p>
            </blockquote>
            
            <p>Then we start converting it to a computerized process. We do this by
            slightly and gradually changing the diagram. The structure of the diagram
            stays exactly the same because the digital process mirrors the human process;
            the only difference is the labels of the different steps within the process.
            For example, “send a courier to pick up the letter” becomes “download the file
            from the website”.</p>
            
            <blockquote>
              <p>Another diagram</p>
            </blockquote>
            
            <p>Because the structure isn’t changing at all, we can also move only part of
            the process over, and this is how things work in real life. When something
            is necessary but unpleasant, we start with the parts that lead to large
            improvements with little effort. In the example above, a good place to start
            is switching the courier’s daily trip for a program that runs every day and
            checks for new files.</p>
            
            <p>The main point in all of this is that data extraction is not magical. Instead,
            we are just mirroring a human process in computer code and being much more
            explicit about what we are observing during the process. As people figure out
            how to automate their own repetitive data collection tasks, they begin to
            realize that anything could be converted into data.</p>
            
            <h3 id="choosing-what-information-to-extract">Choosing what information to extract</h3>
            <p>Sometimes, people conduct complex analyses based on disparate sources of
            information and draw complex conclusions. This analytical process is a
            little harder to break down, but it is still a human process that we can
            mirror with a computer.</p>
            
            <p>In the case of public notices related to development on wetlands, one
            important conclusion to draw is whether to submit a comment on the letter
            that discourages the proposed development. If you think of it enough,
            you can come up with a few concrete variables that you need to extract
            from the data. In the case of these letters about proposed development
            on wetlands, we can come up with a few things that should raise concern
            about the development in question.</p>
            
            <ul>
              <li>The impacted area (in acres) is high.</li>
              <li>The development is in a region that has already been especially stressed
              by other developments</li>
              <li>The letter contains phrases indicate that the development could occur
              somewhere other than a wetland. For example, seeing the phrase
              “shopping mall” would raise concern.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>These causes for concern become things that we observe from the letters
            and put in our dataset; each cause is a variable in our data table, and
            each letter is a row in our data table.</p>
            
            <p>By starting with the human version of data extraction, we focus on getting
            creative about what data we collect rather than getting stuck on what is
            easy to collect.</p>
            
            <h2 id="data---world-csv-soundsystem">Data -&gt; World: csv soundsystem</h2>
            <p>I just talked for way-too-long about how to convert the world into data.
            Now let’s go in the other direction: How do we convert data back into real things?
            Everyone realizes that you can make graphs out of data, but those can be hard for
            some people to understand. Moreover, they still feel like data rather than the
            real world. In order to teach this concept, I convert data into real things while
            still conveying the complex relationships within the data.</p>
            
            <p>This theme underlies much of <a href="http://csvsoundsystem.com">csv soundsystem</a>’s work.
            Most of us in CSV work in journalism, so it makes sense that we’re always thinking
            about how to make data into stories that are accessible to ordinary people.</p>
            
            <h3 id="music-videos">Music videos</h3>
            <p>We’re most known for our music videos.</p>
            
            <p>A while ago, I made a video about the gifts my true love gave to me
            on the twelve days of Christmas.</p>
            
            <iframe width="560" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/rLZDvXPIDa0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
            
            <p>Then CSV made a music video about the financial crisis.</p>
            
            <p><a href="http://fms.csvsoundsystem.com"><img alt="FMS Symphony" src="fms.png" class="wide" /></a></p>
            
            <p>More recently, I made one about transit ridership in Chicago and New York.</p>
            
            <video width="100%" src="/!/ridership-rachenitsa/transit.webm"></video>
            
            <p>And here’s a show we played.</p>
            
            <iframe src="//player.vimeo.com/video/76190871" width="500" height="281" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
            <p><a href="http://vimeo.com/76190871">csv soundsystem at Codame</a> from <a href="http://vimeo.com/lamthuyvo">Lam Thuy Vo</a> on <a href="https://vimeo.com">Vimeo</a>.</p>
            
            <p>When people hear this, they just think of it as music. But it
            gives us an opportunity to explain how anything that people
            manipulate (like notes that we play on an instrument) can be
            informed by data.</p>
            
            <h3 id="data-gastronomification">Data gastronomification</h3>
            <p>We also started getting into data gastronomification, that is,
            turning data into food. Here are some
            <a href="https://twitter.com/internetrebecca/status/352955293291913217">data cookies</a>
            and some
            <a href="">data guacamole</a></p>
            
            <p>Again, we’re just making normal food, and it gives us an opportunity
            to talk about relating data to the real world.</p>
            
            <h3 id="interactivity">Interactivity</h3>
            <p>When people see a wacky thing that csv soundsystem made with data,
            they start thinking about the idea that data can be converted into
            anything. What really hammers it home is that we make tools that
            let you create your own data-driven music and gastronomifications.
            We have packages that let you compose music in
            <a href="https://github.com/csv/ddr">R</a>, and
            <a href="https://github.com/csv/ddpy">Python</a>,
            <a href="https://github.com/csv/sheetmusic">Google Spreadsheets</a>,
            and we have a package that lets you convert data into
            <a href="https://github.com/csv/gastronomify">recipes for food</a>
            (Here’s a video <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CiDW7NVa8o">a video</a> about them.)</p>
            
            <p>For people who are already comfortable with R, Python or Google
            Spreadsheets, these packages feel like any other package. Without
            knowing much about music or food, people can make their own data
            sonifications and data gastronomifications. With this power, people
            start thinking more creatively about how to convert data into
            real things rather than just graphs and tables.</p>
            
            <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
            <p>When one wants to learn about the history of a topic or the use
            of a specific tool, a typical book or class can work quite well.
            I don’t think they work as well for teaching more abstract ways
            of thinking, like the idea that data can be extracted from anything
            and that data can be turned into anything.</p>
            
            <p>Instead of teaching a normal class, I show people something that,
            at first, seems impossible. They get curious about how music could
            possibly be created from data about the federal treasury, and they
            want to know how it works. As they learn about how it works,
            they also learn the deeper concept that we can convert anything
            into data and can convert data into anything.</p>
