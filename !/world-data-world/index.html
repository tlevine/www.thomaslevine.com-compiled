          <article>
            <p>To me, it is common sense that data could be extracted from a pair
            of pants and that that data could be converted into a slice of apple pie.
            But for many people, it is not common sense. I think that people need
            to get this concept before they can understand how we use data to
            influence our world. Things that seemed impossible before one understands
            this concept become common sense after one really gets it, and I’ve been
            using interactive technology to teach people that.</p>
            
            <p>I break this article into three major sections.</p>
            
            <ol>
              <li>What I mean by “data”, and why we want them</li>
              <li>How to teach that we can extract data from anything</li>
              <li>How to teach that we can convert data into anything</li>
            </ol>
            
            <h2 id="what-data-are-and-why-we-want-them">What data are, and why we want them</h2>
            <p>People use the word “data” to mean everything, so I never really know
            what people mean when they’re talking about it. For the purposes of the
            present article, I’m considering data to be a collection of things,
            where each thing is represented in some digital, quantified, or
            structured form. I typically think of this as tables, with each column
            being a variable and each row being a different thing in the collection.</p>
            
            <p>Regardless of whether you think of this as a table, this representation
            is helpful because much of our quantitative methods expect inputs in this
            form. Once we express the world in this form, we can apply any of our
            quantitative methods (statistics, machine learning, modelling, whatever
            you want to call them) and discover things that would have been hard to
            discover without the help of math and computers.</p>
            
            <h2 id="world---data-we-can-extract-data-from-anything">World -&gt; Data: We can extract data from anything</h2>
            <p>We can collect information from the world and convert it into data.
            This tends to come to people more easily. The main point here is to
            recognize that people already do things like this, though the result
            is not always so precise and concrete as a dataset. I teach this
            step of data extraction by gradually switching human processes to
            digital, data-based processes.</p>
            
            <p>The main point that I try to convey is that computers are not magical
            and you can get them to do anything that a group of people could do.
            Anything is possible if you can articulate it clearly enough.</p>
            
            <h3 id="architecture">Architecture</h3>
            <p>When people ask me to teach web scraping,
            they expect me to tell them what Python code to write to pull the
            numbers out of the web page. If I have time, I get to that, but I
            start by breaking down the process by which a human would collect the
            data.</p>
            
            <p>It’s best to do this with a process that the learners already
            know well, especially if they already want to convert it to a more
            automated process. But if the students don’t have a good example, I use
            <a href="https://github.com/tlevine/scott">Scott</a>, my wetlands permit application
            monitoring system.</p>
            
            <p>We walk through it as a human process and draw a diagram.
            In the case of Scott, the resulting diagram looks like this.</p>
            
            <blockquote>
              <p>If you are reading this, tell me to add the diagram.</p>
            </blockquote>
            
            <p>Then we start converting it to a computerized process. We do this by
            slightly and gradually changing the diagram. The structure of the diagram
            stays exactly the same because the digital process mirrors the human process;
            the only difference is the labels of the different steps within the process.
            For example, “send a courier to pick up the letter” becomes “download the file
            from the website”.</p>
            
            <blockquote>
              <p>Another diagram</p>
            </blockquote>
            
            <p>Because the structure isn’t changing at all, we can also move only part of
            the process over, and this is how things work in real life. When something
            is necessary but unpleasant, we start with the parts that lead to large
            improvements with little effort. In the example above, a good place to start
            is switching the courier’s daily trip for a program that runs every day and
            checks for new files.</p>
            
            <p>The main point in all of this is that data extraction is not magical. Instead,
            we are just mirroring a human process in computer code and being much more
            explicit about what we are observing during the process.</p>
            
            <h3 id="choosing-what-information-to-extract">Choosing what information to extract</h3>
            <p>Sometimes, people conduct complex analyses based on disparate sources of
            information and draw complex conclusions. This analytical process is a
            little harder to break down, but it is still a human process that we can
            mirror with a computer.</p>
            
            <p>In the case of public notices related to development on wetlands, one
            important conclusion to draw is whether to submit a comment on the letter
            that discourages the proposed development. If you think of it enough,
            you can come up with a few concrete variables that you need to extract
            from the data. In the case of these letters about proposed development
            on wetlands, we can come up with a few things that should raise concern
            about the development in question.</p>
            
            <ul>
              <li>The impacted area (in acres) is high.</li>
              <li>The development is in a region that has already been especially stressed
              by other developments</li>
              <li>The letter contains phrases indicate that the development could occur
              somewhere other than a wetland. For example, seeing the phrase
              “shopping mall” would raise concern.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>These causes for concern become things that we observe from the letters
            and put in our dataset; each cause is a variable in our data table, and
            each letter is a row in our data table.</p>
            
            <p>By starting with the human version of data extraction, we focus on getting
            creative about what data we collect rather than getting stuck on what is
            easy to collect.</p>

            <p>I just talked for way-too-long about how to convert the world into data.
            Now let’s go in the other direction: How do we convert tidy data tables
            back into real things?</p>
            
            <p>This theme underlies much of <a href="http://csvsoundsystem.com">CSV Soundsystem</a>’s work.
            Most of us in CSV work in journalism, so it makes sense that we’re always thinking
            about how to make data into stories that are accessible to ordinary people.</p>
            
            <h3 id="music-videos">Music videos</h3>
            <p>We’re most known for our music videos.</p>
            
            <p>A while ago, I made a video about the gifts my true love gave to me
            on the twelve days of Christmas.</p>
            
            <iframe width="560" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/rLZDvXPIDa0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
            
            <p>Then CSV made a music video about the financial crisis.</p>
            
            <p><a href="http://fms.csvsoundsystem.com"><img alt="FMS Symphony" src="fms.png" class="wide" /></a></p>
            
            <p>More recently, I made one about transit ridership in Chicago and New York.</p>
            
            <video width="100%" src="/!/ridership-rachenitsa/transit.webm"></video>
            
            <p>And here’s a show we played.</p>
            
            <iframe src="//player.vimeo.com/video/76190871" width="500" height="281" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

            <p>We have some tools for making these music videos</p>

            </ul>
            
            <h3 id="data-gastronomification">Data gastronomification</h3>
            <p>We also started getting into data gastronomification, that is,
            turning data into food.</p>
            
            <ul>
              <li><a href="https://github.com/csv/gastronomify">gastronomify</a> R package</li>

            <h3 id="data-driven-prose-and-poetry">Data-driven prose and poetry</h3>
            <p>Other people in CSV are quite into Twitter bots and into finding
            unintentional haikus. Check out our <a href="http://twitter.com/TreasuryIO">TreasuryIO</a> bot!</p>
            
            <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
            <p>When one wants to learn about the history of a topic or the use
            of a specific tool, I find that a typical book or class works quite
            well. I don’t think they work as well for teaching more abstract ways
            of thinking, like the idea that data can be extracted from anything
            and that data can be turned into anything.</p>
            
            <p>Instead of teaching a normal class, I show people something that seems
            impossible until you understand the concept that I am teaching. People
            get curious and want to know how it works. When they read about how it
            works, they also learn this deeper concept that we can convert anything
            into data and can convert data into anything.</p>
