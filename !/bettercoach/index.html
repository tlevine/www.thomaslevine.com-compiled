<article><p>The <a href="http://coachusa.com">Coach</a> <a href="http://coachcanada.ca">bus</a>
<a href="http://shortlinebus.com">schedule-finder</a> is hard-to-use,
so I made a <a href="http://bettercoa.ch">better one</a>.</p>

<p>But the official schedule-finder is actually sort of cool,
at least for its time.</p>

<h2 id="original-finder">Original finder</h2>
<p>The Coach site’s way of changing one drop-down menu option when you change another
is simple and robust. And it probably made a lot more sense if you were using dial-up.</p>

<p>It works like this.
It’s one little section of the main Coach website.
You first select the state from where you’re starting your trip.
Then it presents you the cities in that state. Then you select one,
and it shows you the states you can go to. And so on.</p>

<p>Getting feedback like this before having completed the form is
pretty common these days with asynchronous JavaScript.
I suspect that the Coach site was built before people knew how to do that.
So they did something slightly different.</p>

<p>First, they wrap the whole schedule-finder in an iframe.
This way, they can reload the schedule-finder without reloading
the rest of the Coach homepage.</p>

<p>The four drop-down menus are inside this iframe.
Instead of asynchronously contacting the server on each
change of the form, they submit the form each time;
there are four form elements (Actually more, but those are unnecessary.)
inside the iframe, and javascript automatically
submits each individual form when you change its drop-down menu.
This is actually quite similar to how we do form validation
today, except that it’s synchronous.</p>

<p>It’s quite slow, but that’s mainly because of something in the backend,
like maybe an over-loaded, poorly configured server
making inefficient database queries.
Aside from that, it’s seems slow because it’s synchronous.</p>

<p>But consider what it would have been like on dial-up.
Making multiple connections and having a slow server
would be less significant because of how long each transfer
would take. By dividing up the list and putting it in an iframe,
they allow you to stay on the home page, reloading just a small part.
The real savings in time is errors; if they didn’t have this sort of validation,
they would have to send two lists of 360 stations each every time you
selected a route that didn’t exist. By doing it as they did, they
prevent errors and thus prevent this slow sending of station lists.</p>

<h2 id="problems-with-the-original-finder">Problems with the original finder</h2>
<p>As cool as I think the original finder is, I still think it sucks.
The main annoyance is that it’s slow. Secondarily, the page could
be less visually noisy. I only ever go to the website to check
schedules, and the other things probably just distract me.</p>

<p>While working on BetterCoach, I also noticed that the
official schedule-finder requires Javascript.
To say it fancy-like, it does not degrade gracefully.
They could have done without Javascript by adding appropriate buttons.</p></article>
