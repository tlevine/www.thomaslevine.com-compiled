            <h1>Open data licensing</h1>
            <p>I downloaded all of the metadata files from 102 open data
            portals hosted on CKAN, Socrata and OpenDataSoft. Each of
            these data portal softwares has a metadata field for the
            license of each particular dataset. In the present article,
            I look at this metadata field.</p>
            
            <p><strong>tl;dr</strong>: It turns out that most of
            the datasets don’t have licenses. Or if they do, it’s not
            specified in this field. I think it would be nice if they did.</p>
            
            <h2 id="the-portals">The portals</h2>
            <p>I looked at <a href="https://github.com/tlevine/open-data-download/blob/3115221f193e08d2e83eb753e8154ea9593fec55/portals.py">these portals</a>,
            but I ignored the following three because they aren’t associated with specific governments.</p>
            
            <ul>
              <li>datahub.io</li>
              <li>datastore.opendatasoft.com</li>
              <li>opendata.socrata.com</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h2 id="reducing-license-names">Reducing license names</h2>
            <p>I made a <a href="https://github.com/tlevine/open-data-download/blob/3115221f193e08d2e83eb753e8154ea9593fec55/query-license.py#L5">rough mapping</a>
            between the free-form names of the
            licenses and some standard licenses.
            For example, <a href="http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/">CC0</a> 
            and other public domain licenses got grouped into “Public Domain”.</p>
            
            <p>I didn’t test this
            very well, so there are probably some errors, but I think
            these results are still informative.</p>
            
            <h2 id="do-people-specify-a-license-at-all">Do people specify a license at all?</h2>
            <p>In doing this, I distinguished between whether a license was
            specified. Here’s a histogram of the proportion of datasets
            with licenses, by portal. Portals on the right of the graph
            specified licenses for most of their datasets, and portals on
            the left specified licenses for few of their datasets.</p>
            
            <p><img src="p1.png" alt="Do portals indicate the licenses of their datasets?" class="wide" /></p>
            
            <p>I was actually slightly surprised that people had set licenses
            at all.</p>
            
            <h2 id="which-licenses">Which licenses?</h2>
            <p>Then I looked at what these licenses (after I reduced them to
            a few standard names) were.</p>
            
            <p><img src="p2.png" alt="Data license use across 100 portals" class="wide" /></p>
            
            <p>As we saw in the previous plot, most datasets don’t specify a
            license. They might be specified elsewhere.
            While many datasets have standard open licenses, the licenses</p>
            
            <h2 id="how-do-portals-differ">How do portals differ?</h2>
            <p>I looked at the variation in this across portal.</p>
            
            <p><a href="p4.png"><img src="p4.png" alt="Data licenses by portal" class="wide" /></a></p>
            
            <p><code>publicdata.eu</code> is pretty big. Like the three portals that I removed
            at the beginning, it isn’t associated with a particular government,
            so I removed it.</p>
            
            <p><a href="p5.png"><img src="p5.png" alt="Data licenses by portal, ignoring publicdata.eu" class="wide" /></a></p>
            
            <h2 id="do-people-put-licenses-elsewhere">Do people put licenses elsewhere?</h2>
            <p>I looked around the websites for a few portals to see whether they
            grant a license somewhere else in the website. Let’s group them into
            two groups: Portals that specify lots of open licenses and portals
            that don’t specify very many license</p>
            
            <h3 id="lots-of-open-licenses">Lots of open licenses</h3>
            
            <h4 id="houston">Houston</h4>
            <p>Everything’s public domain on the
            <a href="http://data.codeforhouston.com/dataset/city-of-houston-funds">data.codeforhouston.com</a>,
            and it says so in the individual datasets, but there’s no site-wide
            license page that explains this.</p>
            
            <h4 id="united-kingdom">United Kingdom</h4>
            <p><code>data.gov.uk</code> is <a href="http://data.gov.uk/terms-and-conditions">more explicit</a>.</p>
            
            <blockquote>
              <p>The data and information available through www.data.gov.uk are available under terms described in the “licence” or “constraints” field of individual dataset records (meta-data). Except where otherwise noted this is the Open Government Licence.</p>
            
              <p>All dataset records (meta-data) published on www.data.gov.uk are licensed under the Open Government Licence.</p>
            </blockquote>
            
            <h3 id="few-licenses">Few licenses</h3>
            
            <h4 id="oregon">Oregon</h4>
            <p>The closest thing I could find to a license on Oregon’s data portal was
            <a href="http://www.oregon.gov/Pages/datamoderation.aspx">this</a>.</p>
            
            <blockquote>

            <p>I suppose that implies that it is okay to copy the data, modify
            the data and supply your application with it, but is this enough
            to give you the right to do that?</p>
            
            <h4 id="italy">Italy</h4>
            <p>Few datasets on <a href="http://it.ckan.net">it.ckan.net</a> specify licenses,
            but it says in two places
            that most everything is released under the Open Database License.
            The <a href="http://it.ckan.net/#credits">“Meta” section</a> of the footer says this.</p>
            
            <blockquote>
              <p>© 2012 Open Knowledge Foundation Disponibile nei termini della Open Database License</p>
            </blockquote>
            
            <p>And the <a href="http://it.ckan.net/about">about/informazioni</a> page says this.</p>
            
            <blockquote>
              <p>Most of the data indexed at CKAN Italia is openly licensed, meaning anyone is free to use or re-use it however they like. Perhaps someone will take that nice dataset of a city’s public art that you found, and add it to a tourist map - or even make a neat app for your phone that’ll help you find artworks when you visit the city. Open data means more enterprise, collaborative science and transparent government. You can read more about open data in the Open Data Handbook.</p>
            </blockquote>
            
            <p>Perhaps this implies that everything is licensed under ODbL unless
            something specifies otherwise?</p>
            
            <h2 id="why-licenses-matter">Why licenses matter</h2>
            <p>Datasets on data portals often lack licenses, and there sometimes
            isn’t a site-wide license for data portals. We sort of don’t need
            licenses on these data portals, but I’d like to see them.</p>
            
            <h3 id="why-we-sort-of-dont-need-it">Why we sort of don’t need it</h3>
            <p>For at least some data portals, it might be kind of safe to assume
            that everything on it is free for your use.</p>
            
            <p>In the United States, this might not be too big of an issue because
            <a href="http://www.lib.umich.edu/copyright/facts-and-data">you can’t copyright data</a>.</p>
            
            <p>Also, products of the United States federal government are public domain,
            so I’d love to think that everything on at least <code>data.gov</code> is in the public domain.</p>
            
            <h3 id="why-we-sort-of-need-it">Why we sort of need it</h3>
            
            <blockquote>
              <p><a href="http://opendatacommons.org/faq/">Licensing is important because it reduces uncertainty.</a></p>
            </blockquote>
            
            <p>In some contexts, the creator of data can’t restrict you from copying them,
            remixing them and distributing derived works. But it’s hard to know whether
            you are in such a context. For example, Oregon apparently has the right to
            require you to add a disclaimer to software that use Oregon data.</p>
            
            <p>The White House gets this. Even though products of the federal government
            are already in the public domain, the White house website makes this
            <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/copyright">explicit</a>.</p>
            
            <p>Even if the public already has the right to the data, you should make this
            clear on the website. This is especially relevant when someone is downloading
            datasets from 100 different portals run by different governments; it’s nice
            not to look up the intellectual property laws for all of the different places.</p>
            
            <h2 id="add-a-license">Add a license!</h2>
            <p>If you run a data portal, add a license, even if you don’t really need one.
            Hmm I suppose I should tell you which license.</p>
            
            <p>If your data portal is associated with a government,
            <a href="http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/">Creative Commons Zero</a>
            seems like a good one to me. This effectively allows anyone to do anything with
            the data as if she had produced them herself.</p>
            
            <p>If you want to enforce that datasets derived from your dataset be released
            openly, consider something like the
            <a href="http://opendatacommons.org/licenses/odbl/summary/">Open Database License</a>.</p>
