            <p>After having watched <a href="">Decay</a>,
            I’m pondering why I would not like to be turned into a zombie.
            There’s something about survival of my current species, but
            I feel like being turned into a zombie is particularly bad.</p>
            
            <p>Being turned into a polar bear, elephant, lion would be less bad. Hmm these
            animals are all magestic, big, strong and, I suspect, more intelligent than
            zombies for conventional measures of intelligence. Let’s consider something
            that is less big, strong or intelligent.</p>
            
            <p>Being turned into mosquitoes, termites or a snake would be similarly bad to
            being turned into a zombie. Maybe it’s something about them being pests.
            Actually, maybe it’s just the gruesome process of being turned into a zombie.
            (I’m imagining the processes for these alternative pests to be as gruesome.)
            If the change happened suddenly and without warning, it would be less bad.</p>
            
            <p>Another part might be hostility to people. We’ve managed to prevent many things
            from killing people, so let’s consider other groups of people. I wouldn’t want
            to develop some mental illness that makes me want to kill people. Similarly, I
            wouldn’t want to be turned into a soldier or white-color criminal.</p>
            
            <p>Maybe it’s something about the killing of people being attributed to the human me.
            Killing people would be less bad if I was a shark, lion or avalanche; people
            might not know it was me, and even if they did, it would be clear that I had
            changed, so they’d probably doubt that the human me would have killed people.</p>
            
            <p>As another approach for looking at the importance of the hostility, let’s
            consider resulting things that we don’t see as particularly hostile. Being
            turned into a tree, dog or rock would be less bad.</p>
            
            <p>I remarked that I’ve been using “more bad” and “less bad” to describe these
            hypothetical transformations, rather than “good”. What would be good?
            I’ve been thinking that my brain would disappear in any of these
            transformations, but if it didn’t, some changes could be cool. Well most would
            be pretty cool, but most would increase my risk of death unless people knew
            that I was the transformed me. If my brain is preserved, the most appealing
            changes seem to be the ones where I’d be less likely to die, like mountain,
            banker and turtle.</p>
