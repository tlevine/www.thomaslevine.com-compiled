            <p>After having watched <a href="">Decay</a>,
            I&#8217;m pondering why I would not like to be turned into a zombie.
            There&#8217;s something about survival of my current species, but
            I feel like being turned into a zombie is particularly bad.</p>
            
            <p>Being turned into a polar bear, elephant, lion would be less bad. Hmm these
            animals are all magestic, big, strong and, I suspect, more intelligent than
            zombies for conventional measures of intelligence. Let&#8217;s consider something
            that is less big, strong or intelligent.</p>
            
            <p>Being turned into mosquitoes, termites or a snake would be similarly bad to
            being turned into a zombie. Maybe it&#8217;s something about them being pests.
            Actually, maybe it&#8217;s just the gruesome process of being turned into a zombie.
            (I&#8217;m imagining the processes for these alternative pests to be as gruesome.)
            If the change happened suddenly and without warning, it would be less bad.</p>
            
            <p>Another part might be hostility to people. We&#8217;ve managed to prevent many things
            from killing people, so let&#8217;s consider other groups of people. I wouldn&#8217;t want
            to develop some mental illness that makes me want to kill people. Similarly, I
            wouldn&#8217;t want to be turned into a soldier or white-color criminal.</p>
            
            <p>Maybe it&#8217;s something about the killing of people being attributed to the human me.
            Killing people would be less bad if I was a shark, lion or avalanche; people
            might not know it was me, and even if they did, it would be clear that I had
            changed, so they&#8217;d probably doubt that the human me would have killed people.</p>
            
            <p>As another approach for looking at the importance of the hostility, let&#8217;s
            consider resulting things that we don&#8217;t see as particularly hostile. Being
            turned into a tree, dog or rock would be less bad.</p>
            
            <p>I remarked that I&#8217;ve been using &#8220;more bad&#8221; and &#8220;less bad&#8221; to describe these
            hypothetical transformations, rather than &#8220;good&#8221;. What would be good?
            I&#8217;ve been thinking that my brain would disappear in any of these
            transformations, but if it didn&#8217;t, some changes could be cool. Well most would
            be pretty cool, but most would increase my risk of death unless people knew
            that I was the transformed me. If my brain is preserved, the most appealing
            changes seem to be the ones where I&#8217;d be less likely to die, like mountain,
            banker and turtle.</p>
