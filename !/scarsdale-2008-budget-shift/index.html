<p>The village substantially reduced expenditures after 2008, mainly in
the capital projects fund.</p>

<p>(I have a graph.)</p>

<p>The fund’s appropriation typically increases by a couple million dollars each
year, but the appropriation was decreased by about $20 million in 2009-2010,
or about two-thirds.</p>

<h2 id="changes">2009 Changes</h2>
<p>More specifically, public building costs were decreased by about $11.5 million,
and highway improvement costs were decreased by about $8.5 million.
(See page 109 of the <a href="https://github.com/tlevine/scarsdale-data/raw/master/budget/2009-2010_adopted_budget.pdf">2009-2010 budget</a>)</p>

<p>The decrease in public building cost can be explained by reduced work on the
Public Safety HQ Renovation/Expansion, which had cost $12 million in 2008-2009.
(See page 117 of the <a href="https://github.com/tlevine/scarsdale-data/raw/master/budget/2009-2010_adopted_budget.pdf">2009-2010 budget</a>)</p>

<p>The decrease in highway improvement cost can be explained by reduced bridge
construction, for which about $9 million had been allocated in 2009-2010.
(See page 119 of the <a href="https://github.com/tlevine/scarsdale-data/raw/master/budget/2009-2010_adopted_budget.pdf">2009-2010 budget</a>)</p>

<h2 id="previous-appropriations">Previous appropriations</h2>
<p>Each budget shows the information for a few years prior. Based on this, it
appears that the budgeted appropriations jumped to a higher level a few years
ago.</p>

<h2 id="public-safety-hq-expansion">Public Safety HQ expansion</h2>
<p>In 2005-2006, the public safety HQ expansion ($5.5 million) was budgeted but
not undertaken. It was to be funded by a bond, so I guess they just didn’t take
out the loan.</p>

<p>The same happened in 2006-2007. It happened yet again in 2007-2008, but the
cost estimate was $11 million instead of $5.5 million. It finally happened in
2009-2010. That year, the cost was originally predicted to be $12 million, but
it appears to have wound up costing only $11.5 million.</p>

<h2 id="popham-road-bridge-construction">Popham Road Bridge construction</h2>
<p>The same sort of thing happened for the Popham Road Bridge construction. In
2005-2006, 2006-2007 and 2007-2008 it had been budget $6.8 million of grant
money, but the money. In 2008-2009, it was budgeted at $8.5 million of grant
money. It finally happened, but it was funded by the federal stimulus.</p>

<p>These numbers are a bit off; I need to add things up properly.</p>

<h2 id="difference-between-adopted-planned-expenditures-and-actual-expenditures">Difference between adopted (planned) expenditures and actual expenditures</h2>
<p>There had been plans for years to spend money on the public safety HQ and the
Popham Road Bridge, but it took a few years before they were realized. They
remained in the budget, however, so you might get the wrong impression of what
the village is spending if you just look at the budget every year.</p>

<p>This gets me wondering about general trends in the difference between what is
planned and what actually happens.</p></article>
