            <h2 id="previous-ear-muffs">Previous ear muffs</h2>
            <p>Ear plugs get annoying, so I got a pair of ear muffs two and a half years ago on
            Christmas. <!-- thread:00000000000116c9 -->
            They’re the <a href="http://www.opticsplanet.com/glock-peltor-hearing-protector-muffs.html">Glock Peltor Hearing Protector Muffs AP60212</a>.</p>
            
            <p>They were pretty awesome. They’re much more convenient than ear plugs, they don’t
            dampen quite as much noise as ear plugs, they look slick enough that I didn’t feel
            weird wearing them at parties, they were cheap, and they didn’t use electricity.</p>
            
            <p>But here are some things I didn’t like. My ears got sweaty and soft, and I wonder
            whether that did something bad to them. They also pressed pretty hard against my
            head. And, most problematically, they broke.</p>
            
            <h2 id="choosing-another-pair">Choosing another pair</h2>
            <p>So now I’m going to get some new ones. I think I looked at some ear muff review
            site when I got them, but I can’t find that site, so I just went to OpticsPlanet,
            the store from which I bought the AP60212.</p>
            
            <p>I looked at their <a href="http://www.opticsplanet.com/hearing-protection-best-rated.html">best-rated hearing protection</a>.
            The most expensive highly rated passive earmuffs are the
            <a href="http://www.opticsplanet.com/pro-ears-ultra-passive-33-shooting-hearing-protection-heads-pe-33-u-b-black.html">Pro-Ears Ultra Passive 33</a>.
            Bizarrely, these are more expensive than the
            <a href="https://www.opticsplanet.com/pro-ears-ultra-passive-28-shooting-hearing-protection-heads-pe-28-u-b-black.html">28 NRR version</a>.
            Also, this one comes in pink. :)</p>
            
            <p>They have a plastic band connecting the sides, rather than a steel band like my
            AP60212 had. This makes them more comfortable and less durable, at least according
            to the reviews.</p>
            
            <p>I decided to get an active hearing protector as well. The following models each
            had at least ten reviews and cost at least $50. I put them here in ascending order
            by price.</p>
            
            <ol>

            </ol>
            
            <p>The first is also noise “amplification”. Maybe I don’t want that.
            Reviews for 2 and 3 suggest that they’re good value. Reviews for the fourth
            suggest that it’s good but overpriced. The reviews for the last one suggest that
            it’s quite good in all possible aspects. And one of these aspects, which the other
            reviews mentioned less, was comfort over an extended period of time.</p>
            
            <p>Reading these reviews, I get the impression that the fancy active hearing protectors
            detect loud noises and add more noise cancelling when things get particularly loud.
            This is quite nice for things like shooting guns, but I started wondering whether it
            would work for me. Here are the things I want them for</p>
            
            <ul>
              <li>Ambient noise in offices and whatnot</li>
              <li>Train, bus, car, &amp;c. noise</li>
              <li>Loud music at parties</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>I read somewhere that active noise reduction is best at ambient noise, so the special
            part about the fancy ones might be how they handle sudden noises like gunshots.</p>
            
            <h2 id="the-ear-muffs-i-chose">The ear muffs I chose</h2>
            <p>I ordered (and received) these two pairs of ear muffs.</p>
            
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Passive</strong>: <a href="http://www.opticsplanet.com/pro-ears-ultra-passive-33-shooting-hearing-protection-heads-pe-33-u-b-black.html">Pro-Ears Ultra Passive 33</a>.</li>
              <li><strong>Active</strong>: <a href="http://www.opticsplanet.com/peltor-protac-electronic-headset-collapsable-folding-headband-mt15h7f-sv.html">Peltor TacticalPro Electronic Hearing Protector - Collapsable Folding Headband MT15H7F-SV</a></li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3 id="pro-ears-ultra-passive-33">Pro-Ears Ultra Passive 33</h3>
            <p>I’ve only worn the first pair for a couple seconds; I was more interested in trying
            second one because it seemed so fancy. But here are my thoughts on the first pair.
            It’s a bit small for my head, though it’s fine if I rotate it back a bit.
            And I think it’s more comfortable than my pair that broke.</p>
            
            <h3 id="peltor-tacticalpro">Peltor TacticalPro</h3>
            <p>Like the other pair, this one is quite comfortable, and it reduces noise quite a bit.</p>
            
            <p>And now I know what “active” means.
            It has a microphone outside each earmuff (half of an earmuffs?) and a speaker inside
            each earmuff. When the earmuffs are off, they make thing quiet. When they’re on, the
            speakers play the sounds that the microphones pick up, but at a lower volume. (You can
            set the volume.) This would explain why it was called “amplification” in one of the
            other products’ descriptions.</p>
            
            <p>These earmuffs also supposedly know not to amplify sudden loud noises like gunshots,
            but I haven’t really noticed.</p>
            
            <p>The sound amplification might be nice for conversations in parties, loud offices and
            subways, but I’ve mostly been leaving it off.</p>
            
            <h2 id="thoughts-for-when-i-get-another-pair">Thoughts for when I get another pair</h2>
            
            <ol>
              <li>Always have something. I got two pairs partly so that I would have one in case I
             lost the other. And passive earmuffs are cheap.</li>
              <li>The active thing doesn’t do very much, but the earmuffs with sound amplication
             might tend to be better in other ways. The TacticalPro feels a bit more comfortable
             and sturdy than I remember the Glock Peltor feeling.</li>
              <li>I read in the manual for the Peltor TacticalPro that it and some other earmuffs have
             lots of fancy attachments. Notably, one is a system for talking to other people
             wearing earmuffs in loud places. That might be cool.</li>
              <li>All these earmuffs press against my glasses. This is slightly painful, it does
             something to my glasses, and it makes the world more loud (because it breaks the
             seal formed by the earmuffs). I want to get glasses that don’t clash with the
             earmuffs.</li>
            </ol>
