            <style>tr { text-align: left; }</style>
            
            <p>I recently took a stab at documenting the
            <a href="http://www.opendata500.com">Open Data 500</a> data format,
            but my <a href="/!/open-data-500-data-dictionary">work thus far</a>
            leaves much to be desired. I looked at it a bit more over the weekend,
            and I think I have a pretty good idea about it now.
            Collecting all of my findings about the data format,
            I packaged the data in a way that should be a bit easier to work with.</p>
            
            <h2 id="more-stuff-i-figured-out-about-the-open-data-500-data">More stuff I figured out about the Open Data 500 data</h2>
            <p>It was pretty simple to convert the data formats once I figured them out, but
            that step took me a while. The main issue was reconciling the conflicting data
            that are reported on the Open Data 500 site.</p>
            
            <h3 id="the-conflicting-data">The conflicting data</h3>
            <p>The Open Data 500 Team released four data files in its “Downloads” section,
            and it implicitly released two HTML data files elsewhere on its site.
            Some of these seem to present the same data in different formats, but when
            I looked closely, I found that they actually contained different data, and
            I wasn’t really sure which data to use. Do I combine the different files?
            If a company is in one file but not another, is it part of the study?
            Is one of the files more up-to-date?</p>
            
            <p>I never really figured out what to do about all this.</p>
            
            <h3 id="all-questionnaire-responses-will-be-included">All questionnaire responses will be included</h3>
            <p>Until I did last week’s research into the Open Data 500 methodology,
            I had the impression that the Open Data 500 involved some assessment of
            companies beyond what they say in the questionnaire. Now, I think that
            the study is just an ordinary questionnaire survey and that they want as
            many responses as they can get. If this is the case, the Open Data 500 Team
            would probably want to report any company that completed the questionnaire.</p>
            
            <p>In assembling my Open Data 500 dataset, I thus think it’s safe to include
            any company that was included in any of the official Open Data 500 dataset
            releases.</p>
            
            <h3 id="only-the-html-version-gets-updated">Only the HTML version gets updated</h3>
            <p>The CSV and JSON versions of the larger Open Data 500 list include
            51 companies each, and the HTML version of the larger Open Data 500 list
            includes 100 companies. I wasn’t really sure what to make of this, but now
            I have a guess.</p>
            
            <p>I scraped the data from the various HTML pages on the site, and I noticed
            that there is indeed quite complete data for all of these 100 companies.
            I thus think that these companies responded to the questionnaire.</p>
            
            <p>Also, I noticed that the “download” section isn’t being updated.
            I downloaded the JSON and CSV files in this section when they
            were first released in December, and they files on the website
            haven’t changed since.</p>
            
            <p>I haven’t been downloading the HTML files regularly, but it looks like the
            site is being updated.
            I found <a href="https://github.com/GovLab/OpenData500">this code repository</a>,
            which seems to be the code for the site. In that repository as well,
            the “download” files have never been updated. But recent development on
            the site has been happening, so I find it conceivable that the data behind
            the HTML files is being updated. The data are being stored in Mongo rather
            than as files in the repository, so I can’t say for sure that the data are
            being updated, but it seems likely.</p>
            
            <p>Anyway, my broader conclusion is that the HTML pages <strong>are</strong> being updated and
            the “download” section <strong>is not</strong> being updated.</p>
            
            <h2 id="packaging-the-data">Packaging the data</h2>
            <p>I produced two different CSV file to describe the same data, and these file
            should make a lot more sense than the official CSV files. One of the files,
            <code>companies.csv</code>, has a row for every company and is normalized. The other,
            <code>datasets.csv</code>, has a row for every dataset, with different rows duplicating
            the data about the companies; it is denormalized and contains no data about
            the companies that lack datasets.</p>
            
            <h3 id="upstream-sources">Upstream sources</h3>
            <p>The data come from the “full list” section of the Open Data 500 website.
            I took most of the data for any particular company from its page on the website;
            for example, most of the data for Appallicious came from
            <a href="http://www.opendata500.com/Appallicious/"><code>http://www.opendata500.com/Appallicious/</code></a>.
            I also took data from the <a href="http://www.opendata500.com/candidates">full list page</a>.
            If the same field was present on both pages (for example, the company name),
            I used the value on the company’s particular page rather than the value on the
            main “full list” page.</p>
            
            <h3 id="schema-of-the-companies-file">Schema of the companies file</h3>
            <p>This version of the dataset is a single CSV file,
            where each row is a company and most columns
            are answers to questionnaire questions. (I think! Remember that I’m guessing at
            all of this.) Here are the columns that I think to come from the first page of
            the questionnaire.</p>

            <p>The <code>dataset</code> field contains a CSV file of the datasets listed on subsequent
            pages of the questionnaire. This file has a row for each dataset, and it has
            columns for the URL (<code>dataset.url</code>) and name (<code>dataset.name</code>) of the dataset.</p>
            
            <p>The three remaining fields are not from the questionnaire</p>

                <tr>

            <p>And I suspect that the <code>sectors(s)</code> column comes from the questionnaire,
            but I haven’t figured out what question it’s from.</p>
            
            <h3 id="schema-of-the-datasets-file">Schema of the datasets file</h3>
            <p>In the datasets file, each row is a dataset used by a company.
            The datasets file contains all of the columns that are in the companies
            file except for the <code>datasets</code> column, and it adds two more columns:
            <code>dataset.url</code> for the link to the dataset, and <code>dataset.name</code> for the
            name of the dataset. These are the two columns inside the nested CSV
            files in the companies file.</p>
            
            <p>Because each row is about a dataset, this file contains no data about
            companies with zero datasets.</p>
            
            <h3 id="questionnaire-versus-undocumented-data-collection">Questionnaire versus undocumented data collection</h3>
            <p>I separate the data collection methods for the Open Data 500 into two methods.</p>
            
            <ol>
              <li>Convenience-sampled questionnaire responses
             (“<a href="#comprehensive-call-sampling-strategy">comprehensive call</a>”)</li>
              <li>Undocumented data collection</li>
            </ol>
            
            <p>Data from both sorts of data collection are included in the companies dataset,
            and the <code>data.collection</code> field indicates which method was used.
            You’ll also notice that much of the data are missing for rows that were
            collected with the undocumented method.</p>
            
            <p>The datasets file, on the other hand, contains no data about companies that
            were collected through the undocumented method; in the undocumented data
            collection method, no data were produced about datasets used by the companies.</p>
            
            <h2 id="using-the-data">Using the data</h2>
            <p>You can download the files here.</p>

            </ul>
            
            <p>I’ve also packaged the it as a
            <a href="http://data.okfn.org/standards/data-package">Data Package</a>,
            so you can check out the git repository
