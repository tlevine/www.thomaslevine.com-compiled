<p>Since they didn’t know, I looked at students at a university. Cornell University
email addresses can contain two or three letters, depending on whether the Cornellian
has a middle name. I <a href="https://gitorious.org/tlevine/toilet_survey/blobs/master/sample/ced.sh">retrieved</a>
all of the email addresses of then-current Cornell University students from the
<a href="http://www.it.cornell.edu/services/thunderbird/howto/troubleshooting_detail.cfm?id=143944">Cornell Electronic Directory</a>
and came up with this plot.</p>

<p><img src="/!/middle-names/cornell_middle_names_by_school.png" alt="A plot of middle name prevalence by school among Cornell University
  shows that 15824 students had middle names and 6649 not and that the
  proportion varies substantially by school, the graduate school
  having a particularly low rate of middle names and the agriculture
  school having a particularly high rate.
" /></p>

<p>Based on discussions with some of the students in that census,
I suspected that students underreport rather than
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJgaaAfhR5I&amp;t=7m51s">overreport</a>
middle names and that the under-reporting is generally an accident.</p>

<p>A year later, I finally got around to testing that.
I <a href="https://github.com/tlevine/united-states-middlenames">looked at</a>
the names of <a href="http://ssdmf.info">85,822,194 dead Americans</a>
and came up with some more plots.</p>

<p><a href="/!/middle-names/us_middle_names_over_time_by_state.pdf">
  <img src="/!/middle-names/us_middle_names_over_time.png" alt="Plot of middle name prevalence as a function of time by state,
    showing a relatively sharp increase from 10% to 80% between 1880
    and 1930, followed by a plateau until 1960, followed by a
    smaller jump to 95% by 1975
  " />
</a></p>

<p>The rate of middle names for dead people born<sup id="fnref:birth"><a href="#fn:birth" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> these days is about 90%,
which is a lot more than the Cornell University student figures; this
supports my suspicion that people under-report rather than over-report.</p>

<p>I was somewhat surprised that reported middle name prevalance varied so much
over time but so relatively little by state. I suspect that most of the
increase over time is explained by improvement of office procedures, but I
wonder what explains slower increases around 1955 and 1990.</p>

<p>The death file provides a lot more data than I’ve shown you here, so
check with me in a couple months to see what else I come up with.</p>
