            <p>One Monday morning, <a href="">Matt</a>, <a href="">Marina</a>, <a href="">James</a>, and I
            were hanging out at Matt’s house. Matt’s roommates were also
            around, and one of them remarked that it was odd that we were
            all at home rather than at work.</p>
            
            <p>“Are you striking because BART isn’t?”, she asked.
            <a href="">Bay Area Rapit Transit</a>
            workers had been considering a strike, so this was a joke.
            But I decided then that we were indeed on strike, against
            boring and exploitative work. Matt had just left his job,
            Marina was working full-time (I think.) but not from a
            particular office, James has never had a real job, and I
            was working part-time.</p>
            
            <p>I also decided that I (and probably we all) was retired.
            I didn’t have enough money saved up that I could live off
            it for the rest of my life, but my situation was such that
            I could probably do whatever I wanted for the rest of my
            life and that money wouldn’t be hard to find.</p>
            
            <p>The above anecdote was from October 2013. I now feel
            qualified to say that I’m retired.</p>
            
            <h2 id="expenses">Expenses</h2>
            <p>I’ve rarely ever thought much about what I spend, but it
            always seems to be much lower than that of other people.
            A high estimate of my yearly expenses is $20,000, most of
            which is for housing.</p>
            
            <p>thoughts about housing</p>
            
            <p>alcohal, weed, cigarettes, coffee, tea</p>
            
            <h2 id="assets">Assets</h2>
            <p>My parents saved money for me to go to college, and I only
            spent half of that. I’d rather not put the remaining money
            to ordinary living expenses, but I’m comfortable putting it
            towards schooling for a child, should I have one. If we assume
            an inflation-adjusted interest rate of 5% per year, this money
            will triple in 25 years, so it should be more than enough to
            put someone through college.</p>
            
            <p>I’ve also been making money myself. About $XXX of my savings
            can be attributed to my own earnings, and I’m presently making
            $XXX.</p>
