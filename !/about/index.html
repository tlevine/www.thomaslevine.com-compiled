<article><h2 id="efficiency">Efficiency</h2>

<p>Thomas Levine likes to make things more efficient. When he was a young child,
he built assembly lines for fun. He only realized that this was weird in
college as he was refactoring a business process for piling snow onto a snow
fort. Tom apparently knows how to improve human processes, and that’s nice, but
entirely replacing them with computers is better and normally easier.</p>

<p>While it’s nice when Tom can make things more efficient, he suspects that
improving efficiency is more efficiently accomplished when he teaches other
people to make things more efficient more efficiently. Tom thinks that this
explains why he does “ergonomics research” and “data science”.</p>

<p>Consideration of the efficiency of a process involves consideration of some
costs and goals. People often select stupid costs and goals when supposedly
considering efficiency. As such, the word “efficiency” isn’t particularly
helpful for describing what Tom likes; it’s just the best word that he could
come up with. Someone said something that may appear to contradict Tom’s
supposed preference for efficiency.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Tom is concerned, not with the matter at hand, but with his social
experiments, and is trying to manipulate the rest of us into diverting our
efforts from things that are actually useful, to things that are only useful
to his own pursuit of knowledge</p>

<h2 id="other-things">Other things</h2>

<p>Tom sees no distinction between work and play.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[Thomas Levine] care[s] only about [his] social experiments. [He does]
not discriminate between frivolities and things of actual importance</p>

  <p>Silviana Russo <!-- notmuch show thread:00000000000053af --></p>
</blockquote>

<p>He’s weird in other ways.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Thomas Levine… doesn’t know who Messi is.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>He would not do well in Fight Club.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Thomas Levine is a unique and special snowflake!</p>

<p>And he has superpowers.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[One] of my favorite superheroes</p>

<h2 id="about-this-site">About this site</h2>

<p>Tom didn’t put much thought into this site beyond the selection of colors;
it works decently for him, but other people seem to have lots of trouble
finding things on it, particularly his email address.</p>

<p>Thomas Levine reads the text before images and he doesn’t really pay attention
to images unless he is explicitly told to do so, so he has avoided putting many
images on the site.</p></article>
