            <h2 id="short-version">Short version</h2>
            
            <p>Data science, ergonomics,
            typography, toilets, data
            gastronomy, free software,
            pretend-ironic buzzwords
            and the color pink.</p>
            
            <h2 id="longer-version">Longer version</h2>
            
            <p>Playing with computers since he was young, Tom eventually developed back and wrist pain,
            so he started studying ergonomics and conducting quantitative ergonomics research.
            Then he realized that he’d accidentally become a data scientist. And his back and
            wrists now hurt less. Tom likes using data to help people work less and think more.
            He also has a band called
            <a href="http://csvsoundsystem.com">CSV Soundsystem</a> that makes music from spreadsheets.</p>
            
            <h2 id="complicated-version">Complicated version</h2>
            
            <p>Thomas Levine likes to help people make things work more smoothly. When he was a
            young child, he built assembly lines for fun. He only realized that this was
            weird in college as he was refactoring a process for piling snow onto a snow
            fort. Tom apparently knows how to improve human processes, and that’s nice, but
            he recently has found it easier to replace them entirely with computers.</p>
            
            <p>While it’s nice that Tom can make things more efficient, he suspects that
            improving efficiency is more efficiently accomplished when he teaches other
            people to make things more efficient more efficiently. Tom thinks that this
            explains why he does ergonomics research and data science. (By the way, Tom
            is known to do ergonomics research and data science, and he means to write
            a satisfying definition of those concepts eventually.)</p>
            
            <!--
            Consideration of the efficiency of a process involves consideration of some
            costs and goals. People often select stupid costs and goals when supposedly
            considering efficiency. As such, the word "efficiency" isn't particularly
            helpful for describing what Tom likes; it's just the best word that he could
            come up with. Someone said something that may appear to contradict Tom's
            supposed preference for efficiency.

            > experiments, and is trying to manipulate the rest of us into diverting our
            > efforts from things that are actually useful, to things that are only useful
            > to his own pursuit of knowledge

            <p>Tom didn’t put much thought into this site beyond the selection of colors;
            it works decently for him, but other people seem to have lots of trouble
            finding things on it, particularly his email address.</p>
            
            <p>Thomas Levine reads the text before images and he doesn’t really pay attention
            to images unless he is explicitly told to do so, so he has avoided putting many
            images on the site.</p>
