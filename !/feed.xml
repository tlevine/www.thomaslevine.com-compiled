    <content type="html">&lt;h2 id="open-data-are-open-but-do-their-licenses-reflect-that"&gt;Open data are “open”, but do their licenses reflect that?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I downloaded all of the metadata files from 102 open data
portals hosted on CKAN, Socrata and OpenDataSoft. Each of
these data portal softwares has a metadata field for the
license of each particular dataset. In the present article,
I look at this metadata field.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;tl;dr&lt;/strong&gt;: It turns out that most of
the datasets don’t have licenses. Or if they do, it’s not
specified in this field. I think it would be nice if they did.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="the-portals"&gt;The portals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I looked at &lt;a href="https://github.com/tlevine/open-data-download/blob/3115221f193e08d2e83eb753e8154ea9593fec55/portals.py"&gt;these portals&lt;/a&gt;,
but I ignored the following three because they aren’t associated with specific governments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;datahub.io&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;datastore.opendatasoft.com&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;opendata.socrata.com&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id="reducing-license-names"&gt;Reducing license names&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I made a &lt;a href="https://github.com/tlevine/open-data-download/blob/3115221f193e08d2e83eb753e8154ea9593fec55/query-license.py#L5"&gt;rough mapping&lt;/a&gt;
between the free-form names of the
licenses and some standard licenses.
For example, &lt;a href="http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/"&gt;CC0&lt;/a&gt; 
and other public domain licenses got grouped into “Public Domain”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn’t test this
very well, so there are probably some errors, but I think
these results are still informative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="do-people-specify-a-license-at-all"&gt;Do people specify a license at all?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In doing this, I distinguished between whether a license was
specified. Here’s a histogram of the proportion of datasets
with licenses, by portal. Portals on the right of the graph
specified licenses for most of their datasets, and portals on
the left specified licenses for few of their datasets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="p1.png" alt="Do portals indicate the licenses of their datasets?" class="wide" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was actually slightly surprised that people had set licenses
at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="which-licenses"&gt;Which licenses?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then I looked at what these licenses (after I reduced them to
a few standard names) were.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="p2.png" alt="Data license use across 100 portals" class="wide" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we saw in the previous plot, most datasets don’t specify a
license. They might be specified elsewhere.
While many datasets have standard open licenses, the licenses&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="how-do-portals-differ"&gt;How do portals differ?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I looked at the variation in this across portal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="p4.png"&gt;&lt;img src="p4.png" alt="Data licenses by portal" class="wide" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;publicdata.eu&lt;/code&gt; is pretty big. Like the three portals that I removed
at the beginning, it isn’t associated with a particular government,
so I removed it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="p5.png"&gt;&lt;img src="p5.png" alt="Data licenses by portal, ignoring publicdata.eu" class="wide" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="do-people-put-licenses-elsewhere"&gt;Do people put licenses elsewhere?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I looked around the websites for a few portals to see whether they
grant a license somewhere else in the website. Let’s group them into
two groups: Portals that specify lots of open licenses and portals
that don’t specify very many license&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="lots-of-open-licenses"&gt;Lots of open licenses&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id="houston"&gt;Houston&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everything’s public domain on the
&lt;a href="http://data.codeforhouston.com/dataset/city-of-houston-funds"&gt;data.codeforhouston.com&lt;/a&gt;,
and it says so in the individual datasets, but there’s no site-wide
license page that explains this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id="united-kingdom"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;data.gov.uk&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;a href="http://data.gov.uk/terms-and-conditions"&gt;more explicit&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The data and information available through www.data.gov.uk are available under terms described in the “licence” or “constraints” field of individual dataset records (meta-data). Except where otherwise noted this is the Open Government Licence.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;All dataset records (meta-data) published on www.data.gov.uk are licensed under the Open Government Licence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id="few-licenses"&gt;Few licenses&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id="oregon"&gt;Oregon&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The closest thing I could find to a license on Oregon’s data portal was
&lt;a href="http://www.oregon.gov/Pages/datamoderation.aspx"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source Data&lt;/strong&gt;
Applications using data supplied by this site must include the following disclaimers on their sites:&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“The data made available here has been modified for use from its original source, which is the State of Oregon. THE STATE OF OREGON MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTY AS TO THE COMPLETENESS, ACCURACY, TIMELINESS, OR CONTENT OF ANY DATA MADE AVAILABLE THROUGH THIS SITE. THE STATE OF OREGON EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. The data is subject to change as modifications and updates are complete. It is understood that the information contained in the Web feed is being used at one’s own risk.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I suppose that implies that it is okay to copy the data, modify
the data and supply your application with it, but is this enough
to give you the right to do that?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id="italy"&gt;Italy&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Few datasets on &lt;a href="http://it.ckan.net"&gt;it.ckan.net&lt;/a&gt; specify licenses,
but it says in two places
that most everything is released under the Open Database License.
The &lt;a href="http://it.ckan.net/#credits"&gt;“Meta” section&lt;/a&gt; of the footer says this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;© 2012 Open Knowledge Foundation Disponibile nei termini della Open Database License&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the &lt;a href="http://it.ckan.net/about"&gt;about/informazioni&lt;/a&gt; page says this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Most of the data indexed at CKAN Italia is openly licensed, meaning anyone is free to use or re-use it however they like. Perhaps someone will take that nice dataset of a city’s public art that you found, and add it to a tourist map - or even make a neat app for your phone that’ll help you find artworks when you visit the city. Open data means more enterprise, collaborative science and transparent government. You can read more about open data in the Open Data Handbook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps this implies that everything is licensed under ODbL unless
something specifies otherwise?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="why-licenses-matter"&gt;Why licenses matter&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Datasets on data portals often lack licenses, and there sometimes
isn’t a site-wide license for data portals. We sort of don’t need
licenses on these data portals, but I’d like to see them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="why-we-sort-of-dont-need-it"&gt;Why we sort of don’t need it&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For at least some data portals, it might be kind of safe to assume
that everything on it is free for your use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the United States, this might not be too big of an issue because
&lt;a href="http://www.lib.umich.edu/copyright/facts-and-data"&gt;you can’t copyright data&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, products of the United States federal government are public domain,
so I’d love to think that everything on at least &lt;code&gt;data.gov&lt;/code&gt; is in the public domain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="why-we-sort-of-need-it"&gt;Why we sort of need it&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://opendatacommons.org/faq/"&gt;Licensing is important because it reduces uncertainty.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In some contexts, the creator of data can’t restrict you from copying them,
remixing them and distributing derived works. But it’s hard to know whether
you are in such a context. For example, Oregon apparently has the right to
require you to add a disclaimer to software that use Oregon data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The White House gets this. Even though products of the federal government
are already in the public domain, the White house website makes this
&lt;a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/copyright"&gt;explicit&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if the public already has the right to the data, you should make this
clear on the website. This is especially relevant when someone is downloading
datasets from 100 different portals run by different governments; it’s nice
not to look up the intellectual property laws for all of the different places.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="add-a-license"&gt;Add a license!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you run a data portal, add a license, even if you don’t really need one.
Hmm I suppose I should tell you which license.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If your data portal is associated with a government,
&lt;a href="http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/"&gt;Creative Commons Zero&lt;/a&gt;
seems like a good one to me. This effectively allows anyone to do anything with
the data as if she had produced them herself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to enforce that datasets derived from your dataset be released
openly, consider something like the
&lt;a href="http://opendatacommons.org/licenses/odbl/summary/"&gt;Open Database License&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title type="html">What's in a count?</title>
    <published>2013-09-23T00:00:00Z</published>
    <updated>2013-09-23T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <link rel="alternate" href="http://www.thomaslevine.com/!/socrata-deduplicate/index.html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Lots of governments use Socrata data portals to release their open data.
This results in a super-dataset of datasets that tells us something about
the ecosystem surrounding open data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a &lt;a href="/!/socrata-summary"&gt;couple months&lt;/a&gt;, I’ve been studying the data
about these data and have continuously been dealing with duplicated data.
I finally fixed that, so now I have more accurate statistics on portals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quick preview:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="histogram.png" alt="Histogram of dataset counts by portal" class="wide" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(I’ll explain later.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="types-of-duplication"&gt;Types of duplication&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m concerned with
&lt;a href="/!/socrata-genealogies/#types-of-duplicate-datasets"&gt;two forms of duplication&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="/!/socrata-genealogies/#term-view"&gt;Views&lt;/a&gt; derived from original
 &lt;a href="/!/socrata-genealogies/#term-dataset"&gt;datasets&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Federated datasets, which are just links to datasets on another portal&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id="dealing-with-derived-views"&gt;Dealing with derived views&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s easy enough to deal with the former type of duplication.
One way is to use the &lt;code&gt;/data.json&lt;/code&gt; (or &lt;code&gt;/api/dcat&lt;/code&gt;) endpoint.
Unfortunately, this endpoint only provides the first 1000 entries.
I have been told that this has been fixed, but I had trouble getting
it working this morning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s not a big deal because there’s another easy way. I produced a
&lt;a href="https://github.com/tlevine/socrata-analysis/blob/master/socrata.csv"&gt;CSV file of Socrata data&lt;/a&gt;
a couple months ago. Each row in the file corresponds to a view on Socrata,
and the views that are original datasets have a displayType of &lt;code&gt;table&lt;/code&gt;, I think.
(There’s a notable exception: Sometimes, the original table is private and
a derived view is made available to the public.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="dealing-with-federation"&gt;Dealing with federation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dealing with federation is less straightforward. The &lt;code&gt;/data.json&lt;/code&gt; endpoint
doesn’t clearly indicate whether a dataset is federated, and neither does
my CSV file. If I had been more careful when producing the CSV file, it could
have such a field, but I don’t want to make another one because that took a
long time. So I took the federation links from somewhere else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scroll down on the homepage of a portal (like &lt;a href="https://explore.data.gov/"&gt;data.gov&lt;/a&gt;),
and you might see something like this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="federated-domains.png" alt="Federated Domains" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This shows up if the portal is federating any other portals. It’s part of the
search menu, so it lets you filter your search by portal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I &lt;a href="https://github.com/tlevine/socrata-defederate"&gt;downloaded all of the homepages and pulled out the federation links&lt;/a&gt;.
Here they are, in a rather plain diagram. (Hover over a node to see the portal name.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;style&gt;
  line { stroke: white; }
  circle { fill: rgb(254, 87, 161); }
&lt;/style&gt;

&lt;div id="graph-diagram"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yay! Now we can deduplicate based on federation. I looked through the CSV file
that I produced a couple months ago and removed records that were federated.
That is, if two datasets had the same 4x4 identifier, I kept the one belonging
to the portal that was being federated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="better-statistics"&gt;Better statistics&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I plotted two graphs again to get a feel for how this changes things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="dataset-counts-by-portal"&gt;Dataset counts by portal&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, here’s the graph of dataset counts from the new data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="histogram.png" alt="Histogram of dataset counts by portal" class="wide" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My &lt;a href="/!/socrata-summary/#sizes"&gt;first version&lt;/a&gt;, also below, includes both types of deplication.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/!/socrata-summary/figure/big_portals_datasets.png" alt="Old histogram" class="wide" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="/!/socrata-formats/#how-many-datasets"&gt;version that uses &lt;code&gt;data.json&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, also below,
doesn’t have the derived-view duplication, but it does have the federation duplication.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://localhost:3000/!/socrata-formats/figure/portal-counts.png" alt="data.json version" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="dataset-creation-dates"&gt;Dataset creation dates&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also plotted dataset creation dates over time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="dates.png" alt="Dataset creation over time" class="wide" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hadn’t made a plot quite like this before, but the issue of duplication
has turned up in other plots about dataset creation dates, like in the
&lt;a href="/!/socrata-summary/#time"&gt;original summary&lt;/a&gt; and in the study of
&lt;a href="/!/socrata-formats/#csv"&gt;dataset formats&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="arbitrary-metrics-are-arbitrary"&gt;Arbitrary metrics are arbitrary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dataset count might sound like a decent metric, but it’s quite hard to say
what a dataset is. If you &lt;a href="http://appgen.me/audit/report"&gt;split up a dataset by year&lt;/a&gt;,
do you have multiple datasets? Similarly, if you create
&lt;a href="/!/socrata-genealogies"&gt;lots of different queries&lt;/a&gt; on the same dataset,
have you created new datasets? And do you have more datasets if you just copy
them from another data portal?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m told that there is perennial competition between Chicago and New York
and between &lt;code&gt;data.gov&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;data.gov.uk&lt;/code&gt; over the dataset count on their portals.
Given the ambiguity of this measure, it is quite hilarious that such competition
exists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, that’s the only obvious metric that we see in data portals.
Maybe we need to make &lt;a href="/!/open-data-plans/#data-quality"&gt;new metrics&lt;/a&gt;
before people can stop caring about counts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script src="d3.v3.min.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;script src="graph-diagram.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

    <published>2013-09-17T00:00:00Z</published>
    <updated>2013-09-17T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <link rel="alternate" href="http://www.thomaslevine.com/!/open-data-plans/index.html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I’ve brief suspended my open data studies to prepare
some things for &lt;a href="http://zipfianacademy"&gt;Zipfian Academy&lt;/a&gt;’s
first twelve-week course, but I’ve been accumulating
lots of ideas of things you could do with data about
open data. I plan on doing a lot of them, but I
probably can’t do all, so you should take one of these
ideas and do something awesome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="whats-in-the-portals"&gt;What’s in the portals?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id="socrata-v-github"&gt;Socrata v GitHub&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GitHub has a pretty CSV table visualizer thingy that supports small CSV files.
What proportion of Socrata tables are small enough to be supported by GitHub?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="compare-official-datasets-to-derived-datasets"&gt;Compare official datasets to derived datasets&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;data.json&lt;/code&gt; file contains only the official datasets and the federated datasets.
The search of the site contains all of the derived views. Let’s compare these two to
see what sort of data gets studied within the data portal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="openness-by-department-and-city"&gt;Openness by department and city&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some departments are more resistant to opening data. I’m told that the departments
that are more political tend to be more resistant to opening data. I want to use
open data release as an indicator of politicalness of a department, and I want to
see how open data release (politicalness) of equivalent departments (like education)
vary by city.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="better-search-and-linked-data"&gt;Better search and linked data&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s find links between datasets. Ideally, let’s get a bunch of datasets with rich
linked data about them and try to predict the linkages. Specific things I want to try&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Find datasets that can be joined on common variables (columns).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Determine the statistical unit (meaning of a row) of a dataset.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Aggregate datasets so that they can be joined.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Automatically union datasets by selecting datasets with the same variables (columns)
  and statistical units (rows)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Fill in the codebook (data dictionary). For datasets missing codebooks, we might be
  able to pick some of the information out of codebooks with other dictionaries.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id="data-quality"&gt;Data quality&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id="dataset-and-data-portal-scorecard"&gt;Dataset and data portal scorecard&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The current obvious metrics of dataset and data portal quality are
size, like number of records and number of datasets. There are other
things that we might want to worry about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a few guidelines as to how to do open data.
There’s one from &lt;a href="http://sunlightfoundation.com/opendataguidelines/"&gt;Sunlight&lt;/a&gt;,
there’s one from the &lt;a href="http://www.appgen.me/audit/"&gt;AppGen audit&lt;/a&gt;,
I have a list from a conversation from &lt;a href="http://noneck.org/"&gt;Noel&lt;/a&gt;,
there’s Tim Berners-Lee’s &lt;a href="http://5stardata.info/"&gt;five stars&lt;/a&gt;,
and there are a bunch of open data laws and policies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People like the Sunlight Foundation
have rated the openness of various places. I would like to make
such a rating in a more automated way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="completeness-of-portals"&gt;Completeness of portals&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By looking at data from FOIA and other portals, we can guess whether
a city has a particular dataset internally and check whether it has
been released publicly. Let’s do this across all cities and see whether
a particular sort of data is available in particular cities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="dependencies"&gt;Dependencies&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe one dataset is only useful if we also have another dataset.
For example, maybe we need the mapping from school identifier to
school location before a school dataset is interesting. If we look
at historical release and usage of datasets, we might get an idea
of these dependencies and interactions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="real-outcomes"&gt;Real outcomes&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Open data isn’t useful in itself; it’s useful because good things
will happen if we do. Or at least that’s the idea. As
&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/IanJKalin"&gt;Ian Kalin&lt;/a&gt; says, the data portal
metrics should really tell us how many tax dollars the open data
saved and how many jobs the data portal created. If we’re creative,
we can come up with something like this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="collect-more-data"&gt;Collect more data&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are lots of data portals, and not all
aspects of the various data portals software
are documented. Here are some things that will
help with further studies in the areas discussed
above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Who federates whom on Socrata? Figure this out by checking the
  home pages.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Download data from other data portal software. I currently just
  have all of the Socrata portals, but it won’t be hard to get all
  of the CKAN, Junar and OpenDataSoft portals as well.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Collect data about FOIA from places like MuckRock and FOIA Machine.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id="studies-with-open-data"&gt;Studies with open data&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve been studying the use of open data, but we could also do some studies
that use open data. Here are two particular things that I want to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="gentrification"&gt;Gentrification&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where is gentrification gonna happen next, or where should a hipster move?
Look at hipster places in open data, and model historical data about gentrification
to find places that will become hipster soon. My current thought is that these
places are the ones where it is easy to move and start something new; they might
have efficient housing markets, decent public transit, and open social circles.
Note well: I suspect that my thinking is quite naive and that there are probably
loads of doctoral students working on this already&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="tutorial-on-using-open-data"&gt;Tutorial on using open data&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to do all this aforementioned stuff to make it easier to find and connect
open data. But people might not want to wait until all of that stuff exists.
So I want to make a tutorial about finding and connecting open data from different
governments in order to learn cool things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="bug-me"&gt;Bug me&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a pretty clear list of things to do, but I’ve only planned out the next
couple blog posts. If you would like to influence the order in which I do things,
please take Jason’s lead and bug me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A &lt;em&gt;statistic&lt;/em&gt; is a number that describes a lot of other numbers.
By reducing many numbers into one number, we make it easier to
figure out what the numbers mean; we wouldn’t be able to fit all
of the original numbers in our brain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People usually explain statistics with symbols, but I like explaining
statistics with drawings, 
&lt;a href="https://sudoroom.org/wiki/Today_I_Learned#July_20:_Statistics_through_doodles:_Geometric_computations_of_fundamental_statistical_concepts"&gt;I doodled about statistics&lt;/a&gt;
one time in &lt;a href="http://sudoroom.org/"&gt;Sudoroom&lt;/a&gt;,
and we took videos of it. Watch them here!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div id="videos"&gt;
  &lt;video width="49%" class="back" src="http://bigdada.thomaslevine.com/til-statistics-back.webm"&gt;&lt;/video&gt;
  &lt;video width="49%" class="above" src="http://bigdada.thomaslevine.com/til-statistics-above.webm"&gt;&lt;/video&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id="controls"&gt;
  &lt;a id="play" href="javascript:play()"&gt;&lt;img class="control" alt="Play" src="play.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;a id="pause" href="javascript:pause()"&gt;&lt;img class="control" alt="Pause" src="pause.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;input class="control" id="seek" type="range" min="0" max="1" value="0" step="0.01" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: right;"&gt;
  &lt;a href="javascript:big()"&gt;Big videos&lt;/a&gt; | 
  &lt;a href="javascript:small()"&gt;Small videos&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script&gt;document.write('&lt;script src="script.js?date=' + (new Date()).getTime() + '"&gt;&lt;' + '/script&gt;')&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The videos gloss over the reasons why we have these statistics,
so I discuss those reasons below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="geometric-computations"&gt;Geometric computations&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the video, I geometrically computed four statistics
about the relationships between different variables.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Covariance&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Variance&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Correlation&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Least-squares regression coefficients&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each computation is for the simplest version of the statistic.
For those who like big words, that’s the univariate or bivariate
version, and the population statistic rather than the sample statistic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="why-we-care-about-these-statistics"&gt;Why we care about these statistics&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The videos show the computations of these statistics, but they
don’t really explain why we use these statistics. So I’ll explain
that here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="linear-relationships"&gt;Linear relationships&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot of relationships can be seen as linear relationships.
One such relationship is that between a person’s height and weight;
taller people are heavier, and shorter people are lighter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A relationship that isn’t very linear might be 
&lt;a href="/!/ridership-rachenitsa"&gt;public transit ridership and time&lt;/a&gt;.
As time progresses, weekly public transit ridership stays the same.
However, it does change a lot within the week, with high ridership
on the weekdays, low ridership on Saturdays and lower ridership on Sundays.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The example I used in the video is locations where your friends live,
which might form clusters rather than lines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The four statistics that the videos discuss are ways of describing the
strength of a relationship, and they only make sense to use with linear
relationships.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="covariance"&gt;Covariance&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Covariance is a basic measure of how strong the relationship is.
It is just a number that is&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;zero if there is no relationship,&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;really big if the two variables tend to move in the same direction, and&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;really negative if the two variables tend to move in opposite directions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, the covariance between weight and height is a very positive
number, like maybe 9001, because taller people are heavier. This postive
covariance is represented in the video as lots of orange rectangles in
the top-right and bottom-left quadrants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="positive-covariance.jpg" alt="Positive covariance" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The covariance between number of times a person has eaten popcorn and her
shoe size is probably around zero, because I doubt that these are very
strongly related. In the video, we see this as orange and blue rectangles
balancing out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="zero-covariance.jpg" alt="Zero covariance" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the covariance between cholesterol level and lifespan is probably
a very negative number, like maybe -1337, because people with more
cholesterol tend to live less long. That’s blue rectangles, with my
doodles’ conventions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="negative-covariance.jpg" alt="Negative covariance" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We tend not to use the covariance very directly in practice because
it’s hard to compare covariances directly to each other. The reasons
for this are explained in the video.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="variance"&gt;Variance&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Variance is a measure of how spread out one variable is. It is a
positive number that gets big when the variables are more spread out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s say that two people are cutting wood to build a house. They cut
10 pieces of wood each, and each piece of wood is supposed to be exactly
120 inches long.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One person is very careful when he measures the wood, so his pieces come
out perfectly. They’re not exactly 120 inches long because that’s impossible,
but they’re not spot-on for the purposes of construction. The variance of the
lengths of his pieces of wood is very close to zero, like maybe 3.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other person is drunk and stoned and thus not very careful, so the
lengths of his pieces are all over the place. They’re still around 10
feet long on average, but some of them are 8 feet long, and others are
11 feet long. The variance of the lengths of this person’s pieces is
very high; maybe it’s 300.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We talk about variances a lot when we are estimating the average of a
variable. When we estimate an average, we want to know how precise our
estimate is, and the variance tells us that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="correlation"&gt;Correlation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think of the correlation as a standardized version of the covariance.
The correlation is a number between -1 and 1. Like for the covariance,
positive correlations mean that the variables move together, and negative
correlations mean that the variables move oppositely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like the covariance, the correlation tells us how strongly two variables
are related. The practical difference is that we can compare different
covariances to each other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can compute the correlation between two variables based on the covariance
between the two variables and the respective variances of the two variables.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="least-squares-regression"&gt;Least-squares regression&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe you want to be able to guess someone’s height based on her weight.
Regression is one way of doing this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To predict height from weight, we can use a simple regression that would
tell us two statistics (numbers). In order to calculate these numbers, we
first need to measure the heights and weights of a bunch of people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once we calculate these two numbers, we have a formula for predicting height;
you give the formula a weight, and it will give you back a predicted height.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The formula is a best-fit line, as shown in this image &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Linear_regression.svg"&gt;from Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="regression.png" alt="Regression" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s say we want to know
&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas_laws#Charles.27s_law"&gt;how big a balloon gets depending on the temperature of the air&lt;/a&gt;.
We fill a bunch of balloons with air and put them in different places,
each with a different air temperature. In the plot above, each dot would
be a balloon, the numbers along the x-axis (the bottom) would be the
temperature, and the numbers along the y-axis would be the volume of the
balloon. That is the data we started with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using these data, we calculate those two regression statistics I mentioned
above. With these, we can draw the red regression line.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we want to predict what the volume of a balloon will be at a particular temperature,
we find the temperature on the x-axis, follow it vertically up to the red line,
then follow it horizontally to the y-axis. This is our predicted volume.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="why-statistics-and-math-and-doodles"&gt;Why statistics and math and doodles&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Statistics lets us distill our complex observations of the world into simple
numbers that are easier to understand. Covariance, variance, correlation
and least-squares regression are some statistics that are commonly used. The
text explains why we use them, and the video explains how we calculate them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The formulae for these statistics get a bit confusing when you write them
out as symbols, but math can always be drawn, and it usually makes more sense
that way.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title type="html">The Street Sign Protocol</title>
    <published>2013-09-10T00:00:00Z</published>
    <updated>2013-09-10T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <link rel="alternate" href="http://www.thomaslevine.com/!/street-sign-protocol/index.html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;There are a lot of acronyms on the internet that end in “P”,
like TCP, IP, and HTTP. This “P” stands for “protocol”.
Perhaps you are wondering what a protocol is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Protocol” is one of those words that sounds more special than it really is.
The concept of a computer protocol might sound quite complex, but
it’s a rather generic concept that is something like a language,
an expectation, and a social norm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The way a particular protocol works might be quite complicated, but
I just want to explain the generic concept of a protocol. I’m going
to do this by writing about a protocol that you might not think of
as a protocol.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="the-street-sign-protocol"&gt;The street sign protocol&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m going to document a protocol that we might not usually think of a
protocol. Let’s call it the Street Sign Protocol (SSP).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="street-signs.jpg" alt="Street signs" /&gt;
&lt;!-- http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2132/2302062601_dd0f89779d.jpg
     http://oaklandwiki.org/Street_Signs --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To keep things simple, I’ll actually document a simple version of the
Street Sign Protocol. Let’s call it the Simple Street Sign Protocol (SSSP).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="why-we-might-want-sssp"&gt;Why we might want SSSP&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might already be familiar with how street signs work, but it took you a while
to figure it out. Also, you are probably so familiar with street signs that you
don’t really think about all of the small details that are involved in communication
through street signs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we wanted to tell a robot how to communicate through street signs, it would be
helpful to be very explicit and precise about all of the aspects of street signs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="specification"&gt;Specification&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SSSP is a way of exchanging the names of &lt;em&gt;streets&lt;/em&gt;. It involves
&lt;em&gt;street signs&lt;/em&gt; mounted on &lt;em&gt;poles&lt;/em&gt; near the &lt;em&gt;corners&lt;/em&gt; of
&lt;em&gt;four-way intersections&lt;/em&gt;. Let’s define these terms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A &lt;em&gt;street&lt;/em&gt; is a paved public thoroughfare in a built environment.
  (This definition is taken from &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Street"&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A &lt;em&gt;four-way intersection&lt;/em&gt; is a place where two streets cross.
  Its shape is approximately a rectangle, with one side having the
  width of one street and the other side having the width of the
  other street.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Being rectangular, a four-way intersection has four &lt;em&gt;corners&lt;/em&gt; at the
  usual places.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A &lt;em&gt;pole&lt;/em&gt; is a long cylinder sticking out of the ground.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A &lt;em&gt;street sign&lt;/em&gt; is a flat rectangular thing that has text on both faces.
  The sign is oriented such that the text reads left-to-right.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now we can define the SSSP in outrageous precision and verbosity! &lt;em&gt;You’ll probably
get confused as you read the paragraphs below, so keep in mind that this is just
a very precise and verbose explanation of what we usually consider to be street signs&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each four-way intersection has four corners, and each pole is associated with
a corner of an intersection. Each corner must have zero or one poles, and at least
one of the corners of a four-way intersection must have a pole; thus, an
intersection must have between one and four poles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Poles must be mounted within about ten feet of a corner of the intersection
but not on the paved area of the street or the intersection. (It is okay for them
to be mounted on the sidewalk.) It must stick straight out of the ground; the long
axis of the cylinder must be approximately in line with the direction of gravity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each street sign displays the name of one street. The street sign must include the
name of the street in very large text. This name must be written on both faces of
the sign and must be especially easy to see, even at night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Street signs are mounted on poles, each pole having exactly two street signs.
The street signs must be aligned in a particular way. One of the faces must be
just-barely-touching (tangent) the pole. The sign must also line up with its
corresponding street; that is, the wide axis of the rectangular sign must run
parallel the corresponding street.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each pole must contain two street signs, each one corresponding to a different
one of the two streets at the four-way intersection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="implementing-a-sssp-writer"&gt;Implementing a SSSP writer&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is one possible procedure for encoding street names in SSSP. This procedure
expects a four-way intersection and the names of the two streets as input. It
outputs SSSP (two street signs mounted to a pole near the intersection).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Determine which corner(s) of the intersections the street signs should be
 mounted on. You might consider the locations of buildings, the presence
 of sidewalks, the traffic patterns and the presence of visual obstacles
 like trees.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Print the signs with the street names.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Cast a pole.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Put a pole and street signs on a truck.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Drive the truck to the intersection, and park nearby.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Carry the materials and some tools to the intersection.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Stick the pole in the ground near the chosen corner. I imagine that this
 involves putting up caution tape, digging a hole, securing the pole, pouring
 some concrete and covering it back up, but I don’t really know. If this were
 software, I’d try to use separate pole-installation library so I don’t have
 to implement the pole-installation procedure myself.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Mount the street signs to the pole. Position them about ten feet above the ground,
 with one on top of the other and with the centers of the signs touching the pole,
 and otherwise in the appropriate orientations specified by the protocol. Secure
 them with a sign bracket.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Drive the truck back to wherever you got it from.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id="implementing-a-sssp-reader"&gt;Implementing a SSSP reader&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is a procedure for decoding SSSP. It has the opposite inputs and outputs as
the SSSP writer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Look for poles with street signs at the four corners of the four-way intersection.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Focus on the first valid pole that you see; ignore any others.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Do the following for each of the two street signs.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Read the large text on the sign.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Associate this large text with the street that the sign lines up with.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id="hypertext-transfer-protocol"&gt;Hypertext Transfer Protocol&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now let’s talk about something that people actually call a protocol.
Here’s a simplified version of the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="why-we-use-http"&gt;Why we use HTTP&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you look at stuff on the internet with a web browser, your web browser and
various web servers are sending messages between each other. HTTP is a common
language that all of these computers use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While all of these web servers are expecting HTTP, you can actually send them
anything you want. If it is sort of like HTTP but with a few typos, the web
server might figure out what you meant. But if you sent random garbage, the
web server would not have any idea of what you wanted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have common internet languages for the same reasons that we have common
human languages. If you talk to me in English, I’ll understand you quite well.
I’ll make sense of it even you you are not using Queen’s English. But I won’t
really have any idea what you mean if you use sign language.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We agree to use HTTP on all of these different computers because it makes it
easier for the computers to understand each other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="highly-simplified-specification"&gt;Highly simplified specification&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HTTP is a way of exchanging information between a web browser and a web server.
It involves &lt;em&gt;messages&lt;/em&gt;, which are very long series of words, punctuation and
spaces. HTTP prescribes who sends and receives these messages and how these
messages are formatted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some messages have a &lt;em&gt;body&lt;/em&gt;. This is an embedded series of words, punctuation
and spaces that can be written in any format you want.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each message may have a bunch of &lt;em&gt;headers&lt;/em&gt;. Each header has a name and a value.
There are a bunch of headers that provide some information about the body
(like its size or format), and there are a bunch of headers that provide
information about the system that is sending the message. And there are others,
like the date of the message.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each message is either a request or a response. By being a request, a message
indicates that it came from a web browser and is being sent to a web server.
By being a response, a message indicates that it came from a web server and
is being sent to a web browser. Each response sent from a particular server
to a particular browser must be initiated by a request sent from the
particular browser to particular server.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every response has a body (explained above) and a status code. The status code
is a number that explains whether the request succeeded and any quirks about its
success or failure. For example, status code &lt;code&gt;200&lt;/code&gt; means that the request worked
as expected, and status code &lt;code&gt;403&lt;/code&gt; means that you don’t have permission to do
whatever you tried to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each request must have a method. There are a bunch of methods, and you can think
of them as different commands. Here are a few of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;POST&lt;/code&gt; is the method that asks the server to save a new document.
  It contains a body.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;PUT&lt;/code&gt; is the method that asks the server to edit an existing document.
  It contains a body.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;GET&lt;/code&gt; is the method that asks the server to send an existing document in the
  body of the response (and not to alter it). The request does not contain a body.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;HEAD&lt;/code&gt; is the method that asks the server to do everything that it would do in
  for an equivalent &lt;code&gt;GET&lt;/code&gt; request except for sending the body. Like the &lt;code&gt;GET&lt;/code&gt;
  request, the &lt;code&gt;HEAD&lt;/code&gt; request contains no body.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id="receiving-and-reading-and-writing-and-sending"&gt;Receiving and reading and writing and sending&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A bunch of things in your web browser might initiate a request. For example, opening
a web page makes one request, and loading an image on the web page makes another request.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A computer somewhere (Call it the “web server”.) is running a particular piece of software
(Call it the “HTTP server”.) that is able to receive this request.
The HTTP server receives the request, checks that it is valid, and breaks it into the
method, headers, and body.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then the HTTP server asks something else to decide what to do.
After doing everything, this other thing decides what the outcome was and tells the HTTP server.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The HTTP server composes an HTTP response and
sends that back to the browser.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The browser breaks that into its various parts and accordingly displays a web page,
shows an image or does whatever else was specified.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="a-protocol-is-an-expectation"&gt;A protocol is an expectation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Protocol” means the same thing for computers as it does for people.
There are lots of different protocols, and some of them are very complicated,
but the word “protocol” itself has a rather simple meaning; it’s just
a way that we expect things to work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like how we agree to speak the same language (probably English if you’re reading this)
or to drive on the same side of the street, we agree on a computer protocol because that
makes it easier for us to make computers communicate. We can choose to build computers
that don’t follow standard protocols, but that would make them hard to understand.&lt;/p&gt;
