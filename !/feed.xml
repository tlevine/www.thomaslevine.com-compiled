    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This happened.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="" alt="Screenshot of a facebook message where Danger &amp;quot;gives&amp;quot; Tom the &amp;quot;age&amp;quot; &amp;quot;15&amp;quot;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I received no further direction. So the present writing happened.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I was fifteen, I sent 989 emails.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ notmuch search --output=files $(date -d 2005-03-30 +%s)..$(date -d 2006-03-30 +%s) from:Thomas\ Levine|grep 'All Mail'|wc -l
989
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I received 9730 (10719 minus 989) emails.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ notmuch search --output=files $(date -d 2005-03-30 +%s)..$(date -d 2006-03-30 +%s) |grep 'All Mail'|wc -l
10719
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I made some plots and stuff. Something happened in June 2005.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;notmuch search $(date -d 2005-06-01 +%s)..$(date -d 2005-07-01 +%s) from:Thomas\ Levine
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It looks like that was just a conversation about some mathematical series.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I found it slightly more interesting just to read the titles of the emails.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;notmuch search $(date -d 2005-03-30 +%s)..$(date -d 2006-03-30 +%s)|less
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Things that stand out:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I emailed lots of Gmail invites to myself.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I studied some Esperanto with the help of a tutor, Detlef&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Many emails pertained to these school clubs
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Shakespeare&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Math team, Pythagoreans and chess club (the same group of people)&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Technology club&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I emailed school assignments to myself.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I went to France that summer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

    <link rel="alternate" href="http://www.thomaslevine.com/!/utility-of-cobalt/index.html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;x.scraperwiki.com uses a new infrastructure for running scripts. We call it
&lt;a href="https://github.com/scraperwiki/cobalt"&gt;Cobalt&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It gives you HTTP APIs for creating computer boxes, running code inside them
and querying SQLite databases stored inside them. It also gives you a static
web server running on the box. We’ve been using it to run custom scripts for
our data services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Setting up a project use Cobalt takes a minute, and figuring out how to use
Cobalt the first time takes a few minutes, so tiny projects might be better
off not using Cobalt. (I don’t use Cobalt for most things.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Making a Cobalt box is like making a virtual server, so it is sort of nice if
you want access to GNU/Linux without running it on your main computer or if
maintaining these services seems like too much work. But I still think it isn’t
great for tiny, simple projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But if it’s not that hard for you to set up a static web server and a database
API and whatnot, it’s not that helpful that Cobalt has them. Loads of different
tools can already accomplish most of these components, so there’s probably an
easier way to set up a simple project than using Cobalt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/!/utility-of-cobalt/doodle.png" alt="Manually drawn line plot of 'Utility of Cobalt' as a function of 'Project Complexity'" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The benefit of Cobalt comes in encapsulating different projects into different
computers and in standardizing the ways that different people do things.
Consider complexity to include the number of people working on the project and
to include any reasonable measure of code/architecture complexity, then look
at the doodle above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have more than one person working on one project, it is nice to have
a standard way of doing things and a place to put everything. You could come
up with your own standards, but if Cobalt’s standards work for you, you might
as well use that. We know that the data will be in SQLite, that we can query
it through the web in a particular way, that they are in a particular computer
&amp;amp;c. That’s still not that interesting, though, because there are other ways to
standardize things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have more than one person working on one project, it is also nice not
to have to trust other people’s code. Rather than someone else’s code on my
computer, I can run it on the box. The box contains nothing but the project,
so I don’t have to worry about it breaking anything else. When projects involve
many different teams of people, you also might want to separate your project
across multiple boxes, one box per team. The standard Cobalt interfaces make
this a bit easier.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title type="html">symph.io is the future of data presentation</title>
    <published>2013-04-20T04:00:00Z</published>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;A couple of data scientist friends and I founded &lt;a href="http://symph.io"&gt;symph.io&lt;/a&gt;
to transform the use of realtime big data in business. People have been asking
what we do, so here it is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With our current tools, big data leads quickly to information overload.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;&lt;p&gt;For handle big data, solution is very simple: buy bigger monitor and use smaller font in the terminal.&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; MySQL Borat (@mysqlborat) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/mysqlborat/status/306078371182428161"&gt;February 25, 2013&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve recently been seeing a trend towards animated visual/audio data presentation
experiences. I started toying with this a few years ago around Christmas time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/rLZDvXPIDa0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They’ve recently become more popular. Some colleagues and I developed a
multisensory display of treasury data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://fms.csvsoundsystem.com"&gt;&lt;img src="fms.png" alt="FMS Symphony" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Küechenstudio made a &lt;a href="http://www.kuechenstud.io/datenschau/podcast/ds008/"&gt;podcast&lt;/a&gt;
about some of the other recent advances in data music.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Leveraging animation and multiple senses reduces information overload,
but it also appeals to a younger audience. Here’s a music video that the White
House released to advertise the State of the Union Address. It uses pie charts
and dubstep to appeal to a younger audience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/i85haOoK5os" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Data animations are also becoming popular in experimental physics, for both the
ATLAS and CMS experiments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/pub/AtlasPublic/HiggsPublicResults//4l-FixedScale-NoMuProf2.gif --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="4l-FixedScale-NoMuProf2.gif" alt="ATLAS" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/pub/CMSPublic/Hig13002TWiki/HZZ4l_animated.gif --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="HZZ4l_animated.gif" alt="CMS" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I see a clear trend towards multisensory data displays, and a couple of data
scientist friends agree. We see a major opportunity to disrupt the data
visualization industry, replacing it with multisensory experience.
We have developed a technology for ambient, realtime presentations of complex,
high-dimensional data. This new data presentation method transforms the way
realtime big data is used in business.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title type="html">Data business models</title>
    <published>2013-04-15T04:00:00Z</published>
    <updated>2013-04-15T04:00:00Z</updated>
    <link rel="alternate" href="http://www.thomaslevine.com/!/data-business-models/index.html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I’ve been at loads of hip and non-hip data talks here and there and have come
four categories of data business model in this hip data ecosystem. Here they are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Big storage for big people&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Money in, insight out: Vertically integrated data analysis&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Internal data analysis on an organization’s own data&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Quantitative finance&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id="big-storage-for-big-people"&gt;Big storage for big people&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is mostly Hadoop. For example,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Teradata&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Hortonworks&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;MapR&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Cloudera&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some people are using NoHadoop. (I just invented this word.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Datastax (Cassandra)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Couchbase (Couch but not the original Couch)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;10gen (Mongo)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Either way, these companies sell consulting, training, hosting, proprietary
special features &amp;amp;c. to big businesses with shit tons of data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="money-in-insight-out-vertically-integrated-data-analysis"&gt;Money in, insight out: Vertically integrated data analysis&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several places package data collection, analysis and presentation. I think this
is pretty close to “research”. One example is AIMIA, which manages the Nectar
card scheme; as a small part of this, they analyze the data that they collect
and present ideas to clients. Many producers of hip data tools also provide hip
data consulting, so they too fall into this category.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="data-hubs"&gt;Data hubs&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some companies produce suites of tools that approach this vertical integration;
when you use these tools, you still have to look at the data yourself, but it
is made much easier. This approaches the
‘&lt;a href="http://blog.scraperwiki.com/2012/03/09/from-cms-to-dms-c-is-for-content-d-is-for-data/"&gt;data hubs&lt;/a&gt;’
that Francis likes talking about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lots of advertising, web and social media analytics tools fall into this
category. You just configure your accounts, let data accumulate, and look at
the flashy dashboard. You still have to put some thought into it, but the
collection, analysis and presentation are all streamlined and integrated and
thus easier for people who wouldn’t otherwise do this themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tools like Tableau, ScraperWiki, RStudio (combined with its tangential R
services) also fall into this category. You still have to do your analysis, but
they let you do all of your analysis in one place, and connections between that
place, your data sources and your presentatino media are easy. Well that’s the
idea at least.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="internal-data-analysis"&gt;Internal data analysis&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Places with lots of data have internal person(s) do something with them. Any
company that’s making money must have something like this. The mainstream
companies might call these people “business analysts”, and they might do all
their work &lt;a href="http://blog.scraperwiki.com/2012/07/31/do-all-analysts-use-excel/"&gt;in Excel&lt;/a&gt;.
The hip companies are doing “data science” with open source software before it
gets cool. And the New York City government has a team that just analyzes New
York data to make the various government services more efficient. For the
current discussion, I see these as similar sorts of people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was pondering distinguishing between analysis that affects businessy
decisions from models that get written into software. Since I’m just
categorising business models and these things could both be produced by the
same guy working inside a company with lots of data, I chose not to distinguish
between them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="quantitative-finance"&gt;Quantitative finance&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quantitative finance is special in that the data analysis is very close to a
product in itself; the conclusion of analysis or algorithm is “Make these
trades when that happens.” rather than “If you market to these people, you
might sell more products.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This has some interesting implications. For one thing, you could have a whole
company doing quantative finance. On a similar note, I suspect that analyses
can be more complicated because the analyses might only need to be conveyed to
people with quantitative literacy; in the other categories, it might be more
important to convey insights to non-technical managers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="conclusionary"&gt;Conclusionary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pretend that I made some insightful, conclusionary conclusion in this sentence.&lt;/p&gt;
