    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;x.scraperwiki.com uses a new infrastructure for running scripts. We call it
&lt;a href="https://github.com/scraperwiki/cobalt"&gt;Cobalt&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It gives you HTTP APIs for creating computer boxes, running code inside them
and querying SQLite databases stored inside them. It also gives you a static
web server running on the box. We’ve been using it to run custom scripts for
our data services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Setting up a project use Cobalt takes a minute, and figuring out how to use
Cobalt the first time takes a few minutes, so tiny projects might be better
off not using Cobalt. (I don’t use Cobalt for most things.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Making a Cobalt box is like making a virtual server, so it is sort of nice if
you want access to GNU/Linux without running it on your main computer or if
maintaining these services seems like too much work. But I still think it isn’t
great for tiny, simple projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But if it’s not that hard for you to set up a static web server and a database
API and whatnot, it’s not that helpful that Cobalt has them. Loads of different
tools can already accomplish most of these components, so there’s probably an
easier way to set up a simple project than using Cobalt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/!/utility-of-cobalt/doodle.png" alt="Manually drawn line plot of 'Utility of Cobalt' as a function of 'Project Complexity'" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The benefit of Cobalt comes in encapsulating different projects into different
computers and in standardizing the ways that different people do things.
Consider complexity to include the number of people working on the project and
to include any reasonable measure of code/architecture complexity, then look
at the doodle above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have more than one person working on one project, it is nice to have
a standard way of doing things and a place to put everything. You could come
up with your own standards, but if Cobalt’s standards work for you, you might
as well use that. We know that the data will be in SQLite, that we can query
it through the web in a particular way, that they are in a particular computer
&amp;amp;c. That’s still not that interesting, though, because there are other ways to
standardize things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have more than one person working on one project, it is also nice not
to have to trust other people’s code. Rather than someone else’s code on my
computer, I can run it on the box. The box contains nothing but the project,
so I don’t have to worry about it breaking anything else. When projects involve
many different teams of people, you also might want to separate your project
across multiple boxes, one box per team. The standard Cobalt interfaces make
this a bit easier.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title type="html">On balancing checkbooks</title>
    <published>2013-03-21T04:00:00Z</published>
    <updated>2013-03-21T04:00:00Z</updated>
    <link rel="alternate" href="http://www.thomaslevine.com/!/checkbook/index.html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Balancing checkbooks is one of those things that people say everyone should
know how to do. It’s also one of those should learn in school or whatnot. I
jokingly arrogantly don’t see why.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I never learned to balance a checkbook in school, so when I wanted to account
better for money, looked for accounting software on SourceForge and found that
GnuCash had many downloads, recommendations, &amp;amp;c. Then I installed it and spent
a Sunday afternoon skimming the
&lt;a href="http://gnucash.org/docs/v2.4/C/gnucash-guide/index.html"&gt;GnuCash tutorial&lt;/a&gt;.
This was enough to satisfy me for
a while. &lt;!-- Replace this with a time in months or years--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This leads me to find it silly to learn/teach checkbook-balancing. First,
imputing data on paper is
silly these days because computers can transcribe things much more easily and
reliably than people can. Second, as far as I can tell, the “balancing” a
checkbook thing is just a buzzy word for reconciling, so it’s not really a big
deal. Third, checkbooks seem quite limited. Again, I’ve never properly learned,
but here are a bunch of things that seem annoying to do in a checkbook:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Split transactions&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Double-entry accounting&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Drawing graphs&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Multiple accounts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, I see no reason to teach people to balance their checkbooks;
just use some proper computer-based accounting system.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Scarsdale High School bus schedules are
&lt;a href="http://www.scarsdaleschools.org/cms/lib5/NY01001205/Centricity/Domain/13/SHSBusSchedule.pdf"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.
I want to make a map of them! And maybe do other things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I manually transcribed the file because it’s a small messy scan.
In my &lt;a href="https://raw.github.com/tlevine/scarsdale-data/master/school-buses/bus_stops.csv"&gt;resulting spreadsheet&lt;/a&gt;,
each row is a bus stop on a trip. (The trip from home to school and the trip
from school to home are different trips.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I found some funny rows in the spreadsheet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The same stop is presented twice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And several other rows have “location[s]” at three-street intersections.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Analyses if the schedules will come eventually; I just thought I’d share this
first. And if you can’t wait for me, you can take a look at the

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I previously used “(es)perluette” as my name in a bunch of places. (It’s a
French word for “ampersand”.) As such, people who didn’t know French wouldn’t
understand what I was saying when I verbally told them my email address. And
I would always have to write it out for them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I decided to change my email address to a word with the reverse properties,
to a word that would be easy to understand aurally but difficult to spell.
I wound up with “occurrence”. Here are some other ideas.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title type="html">Changes in Scarsdale appropriations</title>
    <published>2013-01-21T05:00:00Z</published>
    <updated>2013-01-21T05:00:00Z</updated>
    <link rel="alternate" href="http://www.thomaslevine.com/!/scarsdale-2008-budget-shift/index.html"/>
    <content type="html">
&lt;p&gt;The village substantially reduced expenditures after 2008, mainly in
the capital projects fund.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(I have a graph.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fund’s appropriation typically increases by a couple million dollars each
year, but the appropriation was decreased by about $20 million in 2009-2010,
or about two-thirds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="changes"&gt;2009 Changes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More specifically, public building costs were decreased by about $11.5 million,
and highway improvement costs were decreased by about $8.5 million.
(See page 109 of the &lt;a href="https://github.com/tlevine/scarsdale-data/raw/master/budget/2009-2010_adopted_budget.pdf"&gt;2009-2010 budget&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The decrease in public building cost can be explained by reduced work on the
Public Safety HQ Renovation/Expansion, which had cost $12 million in 2008-2009.
(See page 117 of the &lt;a href="https://github.com/tlevine/scarsdale-data/raw/master/budget/2009-2010_adopted_budget.pdf"&gt;2009-2010 budget&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The decrease in highway improvement cost can be explained by reduced bridge
construction, for which about $9 million had been allocated in 2009-2010.
(See page 119 of the &lt;a href="https://github.com/tlevine/scarsdale-data/raw/master/budget/2009-2010_adopted_budget.pdf"&gt;2009-2010 budget&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="previous-appropriations"&gt;Previous appropriations&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each budget shows the information for a few years prior. Based on this, it
appears that the budgeted appropriations jumped to a higher level a few years
ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="public-safety-hq-expansion"&gt;Public Safety HQ expansion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2005-2006, the public safety HQ expansion ($5.5 million) was budgeted but
not undertaken. It was to be funded by a bond, so I guess they just didn’t take
out the loan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The same happened in 2006-2007. It happened yet again in 2007-2008, but the
cost estimate was $11 million instead of $5.5 million. It finally happened in
2009-2010. That year, the cost was originally predicted to be $12 million, but
it appears to have wound up costing only $11.5 million.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="popham-road-bridge-construction"&gt;Popham Road Bridge construction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same sort of thing happened for the Popham Road Bridge construction. In
2005-2006, 2006-2007 and 2007-2008 it had been budget $6.8 million of grant
money, but the money. In 2008-2009, it was budgeted at $8.5 million of grant
money. It finally happened, but it was funded by the federal stimulus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These numbers are a bit off; I need to add things up properly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="difference-between-adopted-planned-expenditures-and-actual-expenditures"&gt;Difference between adopted (planned) expenditures and actual expenditures&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There had been plans for years to spend money on the public safety HQ and the
Popham Road Bridge, but it took a few years before they were realized. They
remained in the budget, however, so you might get the wrong impression of what
the village is spending if you just look at the budget every year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This gets me wondering about general trends in the difference between what is
planned and what actually happens.&lt;/p&gt;
