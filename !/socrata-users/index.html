            <h1>Who uses Socrata's in-browser charting features?</h1>
            <p>I recently downloaded the metadata files for all
            of the datasets on all of the Socrata portals (for a particular definition
            of “all”). And then I remembered that these datasets don’t just float in
            space; <strong>people use them</strong>.</p>
            
            <p>Through this study of Socrata data portals,
            I’ve learned that Socrata is much more than a website
            for converting datasets into different formats and serving them on the web.
            Socrata “<a href="http://www.socrata.com/open-innovation/">consumerizes the data experience</a>”
            with web-based mapping and charting tools. Here’s a sexy video they made.</p>
            
            <video controls="" id="wistia_1" preload="none" poster="http://embed.wistia.com/deliveries/d86ff91b0a3b280ee4fd5fea9b65993d1b250340.jpg?image_crop_resized=640x360" style="width: 100%; height: 100%; position: relative; display: block;"><source src="http://embed.wistia.com/deliveries/37d0ddf8aeb21db020b1059c10c62373c9140734/file.mp4" type="video/mp4" /></video>
            
            <p>I live in this bubble of people who know how to use computers, so Socrata’s
            charting tools seem really clunky and stupid to me, but it turns out that
            these clunky tools can be outrageously useful people who aren’t strange like me.</p>
            
            <p><a href="https://twitter.com/nneditch">Nicole Neditch</a> told me of one instance where someone
            in the Oakland government made a pie chart in
            the Socrata data portal and embedded that in a blog. If Oakland hadn’t been using Socrata,
            the result probably would have been less exciting; Nicole said that the person probably
            would have made a chart in Excel, exported that to a PDF and added a download link.</p>
            
            <p>I wanted to find more people like this. That is, I want to see how people’s approach to analysis
            changes because of these web-based analysis tools that are strongly integrated
            with both the data being analyzed and with web-based presentation formats.</p>
            
            <p>My <a href="/!/socrata-summary">first post</a> looked at popular datasets, and
            my <a href="/!/socrata-genealogies">second post</a> looked at big dataset families.
            In this third post, I look at people who use Socrata as an analysis tool.</p>
            
            <h2 id="the-user-data-format">The user data format</h2>
            <p>In order to do this analysis, I’m going to take user data from Socrata, and this
            involves learning more about Socrata’s API.</p>
            
            <p>I’m still using the same 80,000 JSON files that I <a href="/!/socrata-summary">downloaded</a> last month.
            Each of these metadata files describes a Socrata <a href="/!/socrata-genealogies#term-view">view</a>.
            Some of these JSON files are duplicates (because of
            <a href="/!/socrata-genealogies#term-federation">federation</a>),
            so there are only about 50,000 unique views.
            (And the other 30,000 are exact duplicates, so deduplicating was easy.)</p>
            
            <p><img src="/!/socrata-users/user-model.jpg" alt="Diagram indicating that each view has one owner and one table author" class="wide" /></p>
            
            <p>Among the many fields in each JSON file are
            fields are two fields related to the people who interacted with that view.
            These fields are the <code>owner</code> and  <code>tableAuthor</code> fields. These fields are
            both hashes/dictionaries/arrays with user information. For example, here’s
            mine.</p>
            
            <pre><code>{&#x000A;  "id" : "x73b-9d8f",&#x000A;  "displayName" : "Thomas Levine",&#x000A;  "emailUnsubscribed" : false,&#x000A;  "privacyControl" : "login",&#x000A;  "profileImageUrlLarge" :&#x000A;    "/images/profile/0252/1851/govlab-experiment_large.jpg",&#x000A;  "profileImageUrlMedium" :&#x000A;    "/images/profile/0252/1851/govlab-experiment_thumb.jpg",&#x000A;  "profileImageUrlSmall" :&#x000A;    "/images/profile/0252/1851/govlab-experiment_tiny.jpg",&#x000A;  "profileLastModified" : 1374508383,&#x000A;  "screenName" : "Thomas Levine"&#x000A;}&#x000A;</code></pre>
            
            <h3 id="owner">Owner</h3>
            <p>The <code>owner</code> field is quite straightforward; it’s simply the person who
            created the view, be it a
            <a href="/!/socrata-genealogies#term-dataset">dataset</a>,
            <a href="/!/socrata-genealogies#term-filtered-view">filtered view</a>,
            <a href="/!/socrata-genealogies#term-chart-and-map">chart</a> or
            <a href="/!/socrata-genealogies#term-other-view-types">whatever</a>.</p>
            
            <h3 id="table-author">Table Author</h3>
            <p>The <code>tableAuthor</code> field is the person who uploaded the
            <a href="/!/socrata-genealogies#term-table">table</a> (source data) associated
            with the view. For datasets, this is the same as the owner, but for charts,
            maps and filtered views, it might be different; one person may have uploaded
            the data, and another person might have made the chart. “view”, “dataset”,
            “map”, “chart”, “filtered view” and “table” all have rather special meanings
            inside Socrata, so you should read my <a href="/!/socrata-genealogies">post on that</a>
            if the previous sentence didn’t make sense.</p>
            
            <h2 id="extracting-the-user-data">Extracting the user data</h2>
            <p>I already had a system for storing all of the Socrata metadata, so I just needed to write a
            <a href="https://github.com/tlevine/socrata-analysis/blob/e3d12254e928f986f1a83ed2099577e289048b94/numbers/run.py#L207">sloppy function</a>
            to query it. This resulted in an SQLite3 database, which I converted to a
            <a href="https://raw.github.com/tlevine/socrata-analysis/e3d12254e928f986f1a83ed2099577e289048b94/users.csv">CSV file</a>
            and read into R.</p>
            
            <h2 id="data-summary">Data summary</h2>
            <p>The user data frame schema looks like this.
            (Ignore this block of gibberish if it scares you.)</p>
            
            <pre style="font-size: 0.7em;"><code>str(users)&#x000A;## 'data.frame':	11833 obs. of  18 variables:&#x000A;##  $ id                   : chr  "wivw-ajwk" "6b59-fhhh" "vigz-pjyi" "abb4-qtmc" ...&#x000A;##  $ emailUnsubscribed    : int  0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 ...&#x000A;##  $ displayName          : chr  "Rory Martin" "Roman Russia" "svelz" "Tobit Sibol" ...&#x000A;##  $ privacyControl       : chr  "login" "login" "login" "login" ...&#x000A;##  $ n_tables             : int  1 1 0 1 1 2 2 1 1 0 ...&#x000A;##  $ n_views              : int  1 1 2 1 1 221 2 1 1 1 ...&#x000A;##  $ screenName           : chr  "Rory Martin" "Roman Russia" "svelz" "Tobit Sibol" ...&#x000A;##  $ profileLastModified  : Date, format: NA NA ...&#x000A;##  $ profileImageUrlMedium: chr  NA NA NA NA ...&#x000A;##  $ profileImageUrlSmall : chr  NA NA NA NA ...&#x000A;##  $ profileImageUrlLarge : chr  NA NA NA NA ...&#x000A;##  $ n_rights             : int  NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA ...&#x000A;##  $ roleName             : chr  NA NA NA NA ...&#x000A;##  $ flags                : chr  NA NA NA NA ...&#x000A;##  $ privilegesDisabled   : int  NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA ...&#x000A;##  $ has.flag             : logi  FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE ...&#x000A;##  $ has.role             : logi  FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE ...&#x000A;##  $ more.tables          : logi  FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE ...&#x000A;</code></pre>
            
            <h3 id="missing-data">Missing data</h3>
            <p>Not everyone had all of the fields.</p>
            
            <p><img src="figure/missingness.png" alt="plot of chunk missingness" class="wide" /></p>
            
            <p>In particular, hardly anyone had flags, a profile image, rights or disabled privileges.</p>
            
            <h3 id="how-many-views-do-people-have">How many views do people have?</h3>
            
            <p><img src="figure/n.views.png" alt="plot of chunk n.views" class="wide" /></p>
            
            <p>Most users (7790 to be exact) have exactly one view.
            Actually, there are probably even more with no views, but I don’t have the
            data on them.</p>
            
            <p>That red one way off to the right is the Data.gov Program Management Office,
            with 7618. </p>
            
            <h3 id="how-many-tables">How many tables?</h3>
            
            <p>Let’s make that same plot but for the number of tables. (A table is a raw
            uploaded dataset, before any view filtering. A table can have many views,
            and a view has only one table.) In this plot, I colored administrators and
            publishers red.</p>
            
            <p><img src="figure/n_tables.png" alt="plot of chunk n_tables" class="wide" /></p>
            
            <p>That point off to the right is again the Data.gov Program Management Office.</p>
            
            <h3 id="how-many-derived-views">How many derived views?</h3>
            <p>When you upload a tabular data file to Socrata, Socrata creates a “table” and
            a “dataset” view on that table. When you filter a view inside Socrata, Socrata
            creates a new view but no new table. Thus, the difference between number of
            tables and number of views tells us how many derived views people have made.
            I think.</p>
            
            <p><img src="figure/n_derived.png" alt="plot of chunk n_derived" class="wide" /></p>
            
            <p>It also turns out that 65 users have more tables than views. This appears to be
            mostly publishers. Maybe this is something about how the import API works that I
            don’t understand.</p>
            
            <h2 id="aside-from-data-publishers-and-socrata-employees-who-uses-socrata-a-lot">Aside from data publishers and Socrata employees, who uses Socrata a lot?</h2>
            <p>I wanted to find people who have used Socrata a lot without being employed by
            Socrata or data-publishing governments. I started out by trying to separate
            employees of Socrata and data-publishers from everyone else. That was a bit
            harder than you might expect.</p>
            
            <h3 id="more-tables-than-views">More tables than views</h3>
            <p>As I mentioned earlier, I didn’t realize that it was possible to have more
            tables than views. How does that happen?</p>
            
            <h4 id="an-example">An example</h4>
            <p>One case is <a href="https://data.oregon.gov/profile/rseel/izyb-s78c?">rseel</a>.
            He is the author behind a private table, and 
            <a href="http://www.socrata.com/company-info/leadership/">Cam Caldwell</a>, who works for Socrata, made 
            <a href="https://data.oregon.gov/Health-Human-Services/WIC-Authorized-Vendors/5ew8-h6d9?">this view</a>
            based on that table. So some of the situations where people have tables but no views might
            occur because of private views; the original dataset is private, and some views on that
            dataset are public.</p>
            
            <p>We care about this because this might be a way of identifying people who work
            for data publishers. Considering that this private dataset is posted on Oregon’s
            portal and that a Socrata employee made a view based on it, I suspect that rseel
            works for Oregon, or maybe Socrata.</p>
            
            <h4 id="more-users-like-this">More users like this</h4>
            <p>I looked at more of the users who had more tables than views.</p>
            
            <pre><code>subset(users, n_tables &gt; n_views)[c('displayName', 'roleName', 'flags', 'n_tables', 'n_views')]&#x000A;</code></pre>
            
            <p>I looked up a few of them with a search engine, and they mostly
            <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/jkray">seem</a>
            <a href="http://www.imaginaryrobots.net/resumes/Jesse_van_Herk_resume.pdf">to</a>
            <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/debraagagne">be</a>
            <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/champions/technology-and-innovation/waldo-jaquith">government</a>
            <a href="http://waldo.jaquith.org/">employees</a>.
            So I think I can count people as employees of data publishers or Socrata
            if they have more tables than views.</p>
            
            <h3 id="role-names">Role names</h3>
            <p>I noticed that most of the people in the above list have
            <code>roleName</code> fields. Very few people have <code>roleName</code> fields, so
            I think that people tend to have a <code>roleName</code> field
            if and only if they work for data publishers. To investigate that,
            let’s look at the number of views that each person owns by the different
            roles of user.</p>
            
            <p><img src="figure/views_by_role.png" alt="plot of chunk views_by_role" class="wide" /></p>
            
            <p>It looks like publishers and administrators make more views. Big surprise.
            Moreover, few people have roles, and people with roles tend to have more data
            than people without roles. This supports my suspicion that people with roles
            are data publishers. To test that a bit more precisely, let’s compare that to
            my other suspected indicator of data-publisher-ness: Whether people have more
            tables than views. Here’s a plot of that.</p>
            
            <p><img src="figure/roleName_plot.png" alt="plot of chunk roleName_plot" class="wide" /></p>
            
            <p>If we want to get all statistical about it, we can run
            Fisher’s Exact test.</p>
            
            <pre><code>fisher.test(table(users$n_tables &gt; users$n_views, users$has.role))&#x000A;## &#x000A;## 	Fisher's Exact Test for Count Data&#x000A;## &#x000A;## data:  table(users$n_tables &gt; users$n_views, users$has.role)&#x000A;## p-value &lt; 2.2e-16&#x000A;## alternative hypothesis: true odds ratio is not equal to 1&#x000A;## 95 percent confidence interval:&#x000A;##   35.69 118.94&#x000A;## sample estimates:&#x000A;## odds ratio &#x000A;##      63.77&#x000A;</code></pre>
            
            <p>and find that these counts are indeed disproportionate. </p>
            
            <p>This is all to say that <code>roleName</code> appears to be a decent <strong>indicator for “data publisher”</strong>.</p>
            
            <h3 id="flags">Flags</h3>
            <p>In a similar vein, I looked at Socrata users with a <code>flags</code> field.
            35 users have a non-empty <code>flags</code> field, and
            the value of that field is <code>["admin"]</code> for all of these users.
            Here are those users.</p>

            Socrata employees. I don’t know why they have <code>roleName</code> fields.</p>
            
            <p>Anyway, it looks like the <code>flags</code> field is a decent <strong>indicator for “Socrata employee”</strong>.</p>
            
            <h3 id="ordinary-citizens">Ordinary citizens</h3>
            <p>If having a <code>flags</code> field means you work for Socrata and
            having a <code>roleName</code> means you work for a data publisher (a government, usually),
            then maybe people with neither <code>flags</code> nor a <code>roleName</code> are the
            citizens that Socrata is trying to empower.</p>

            <p>Anyway, I see a pattern here: Users with the most views

            creative, diverse and involved. Here are some of her popular views.</p>

            <a href="http://whitehouse.gov1.info/">whitehouse.gov1.info</a>,
            which is a parody of the <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/">official White House website</a>.</p>

            has made a lot of filters and charts about India.
            He also names his views really well. In particular, I like his hack of prefixing
            all of the titles with “Dave_”; this gets around how Socrata doesn’t make it particularly
            clear who created the view that you are looking at.</p>
            
            <h4 id="everyone-else">Everyone else</h4>
            <p>I looked at a few specific Socrata users who are doing interesting things,
            but let’s look a bit more broadly. The histogram below shows how many views
            users have created. Here, I’m including people without profile pictures.</p>
            
            <p><img src="figure/citizen_views1.png" alt="plot of chunk citizen_views1" class="wide" /></p>
            
            <p>Here it is again, but leaving out the top ten users to make it easier to see.</p>
            
            <p><img src="figure/citizen_views2.png" alt="plot of chunk citizen_views2" class="wide" /></p>
            
            <p>As you might expect, most people make only one view.
            In fact, there are probably even more users with no views.</p>
            
            <p>I’m more concerned with the right side of the graph.
            As we should expect, far fewer people have made 10 views than 1 view.
            But look at the absolute counts. Only 411
            users have made at least 10 views. Keep in mind that this includes
            all of the users who have made a public view on any of the
            60 portals; this number seems quite low.</p>
            
            <p>Also keep in mind that that’s <em>all</em> of the users with at least 10 views;
            if we look at only the users whom I’ve identified as citizens, it drops
            to 38, or fewer than one user per portal. Quite low.</p>

            <h3 id="api-documentation">API documentation</h3>
            <p>Most of my work on this is still just in figuring out what the API fields mean and documenting them.
            Some of you reading this are probably building developer APIs, so keep this in
            mind: If you don’t document your API fully, some random person might come along
            and document it for you, which might be highly embarrassing and/or highly convenient.</p>
            
            <p>Now on to some more serious conclusions.</p>
            
            <h3 id="big-users">Big users</h3>
            <p>I looked for users that published a lot of views.</p>
            
            <p>Unsurprisingly, data publishers create lots of views. And Data.gov is crazy.</p>
            
            <p>Aside from data publishers, there are a few accounts that make lots of filters
            on the same dataset. These accounts might be bots; one of them is even called
            the “Kenya Open Data Bot”.</p>
            
            <p>I found some accounts (not The White House, NL, VinylFox and Dave Francis
            Rodrigues) that are making lots of diverse filters and maps with Socrata
            in study of a particular topic. These are examples of the “consumerized”
            data analysts that Socrata is trying to create.</p>
            
            <h3 id="one-portal">One portal</h3>
            <p>Publishing a lot of views isn’t the only thing that means that you use Socrata a
            lot. Wouldn’t it be cool if people were connecting lots of different datasets from
            all over the place?</p>
            
            <p>Very few of the big users that I discuss above use more than one Socrata portal.
            This certainly makes sense as Socrata open data portals are presented as if they’re
            separate installations of the software. You can use the same account for all of the
            portals, but there’s no obvious way to search across portals or get a list of all
            of the portals.</p>
            
            <p>I wonder whether people would use data from multiple portals if it were easier to
            search across portals. I think someone should set up a Socrata portal that
            <a href="/!/socrata-genealogies#term-federation">federates</a>
            all of the other portals; maybe people would use Socrata Open Data Portal
            software differently if they could easily collect and analyze data from all of the portals.</p>
            
            <p>On the other hand, maybe they wouldn’t. A couple of the bigger users I found
            were using World Bank data, and it’s quite possible that the data in the other portals
            aren’t that relevant to them.</p>
            
            <h3 id="people-dont-use-socrata-that-much">People don’t use Socrata that much.</h3>
            <p>If people are using Socrata’s data analysis tools, we should expect lots of
            views to be created. But I didn’t find that many views.</p>
            
            <p>Searching across all of the portals, I found fewer than 500 users with at
            least 10 views. This is less than ten such users per portal, which doesn’t
            seem like a lot. And almost all of these users are data publishers or Socrata
            employees, so hardly any citizens seem to be analyzing Socrata data.</p>
            
            <h3 id="or-do-they">Or do they?</h3>
            <p>Maybe they’re using the data and just not using Socrata’s analysis tools.</p>
            
            <h4 id="people-do-what-they-know">People do what they know.</h4>
            <p>I think that people get good at one way of using computers and then never learn other ways.

            email software but got confused when she got a new computer with a new version of the email software.
            This also applies for people like me who are stuck using R because they know all sorts of
            <a href="/!/r-spells-for-data-wizards">magical R incantations</a> even though they know that
            <a href="https://stat.ethz.ch/pipermail/r-help/2010-September/252618.html">R is completely insensible</a>.</p>
            
            <h4 id="people-already-know-excel">People already know Excel.</h4>
            <p>Getting back to Socrata, I suspect that people are using the Socrata data to some
            degree but that they’re downloading the dataset manually analyzing it in Excel.</p>
            
            <p>If this is what is happening, it would be really cool to have stronger integrations
            between Excel and Socrata. Currently, you just download a view in Excel format and then
            open it. What if there were an Excel macro that would synchronize a table in Excel
            with a view in Socrata? Or a plugin that would let you upload reports from Excel back
            to Socrata?</p>
            
            <p>Before you get excited, note that I don’t really have any idea of whether this is
            what’s happening. It would be cool to test this suspicion, but I haven’t yet come
            up with a good way of doing that.</p>
            
            <h3 id="maintaining-the-openness-of-data">Maintaining the openness of data</h3>
            <p>If people are analyzing open data in Excel and then disseminating the findings as
            paper documents, then we’re not maintaining the openness of the data.
            There are a lot of situations where the analyst wants the analysis to stay private,
            but there are also a lot of situations where the analyst would love to share the
            analysis publicly if only it were easier.</p>
            
            <p>Much focus in open data is on opening existing silos on data. Let’s also think about
            how we can <strong>prevent data from becoming siloed</strong> in the first place.</p>
            
            <h2 id="a-request-for-data">A request for data</h2>
            <p>I managed to find a few interesting users, but I’m somewhat disappointed.
            The available data are quite coarse, and few variables are exposed.</p>
            
            <p>On the other hand, portal administrators have do have access to these data! If you run a portal,
            you should be studying these usage data in order to understand what data people are using,
            how people are using it and how you can improve your open data offerings.
            Even better, you should just open the usage data
            <a href="https://data.oregon.gov/analytics">like Oregon did</a> so I can do this for you.</p>
            
            <p>If you administrate a portal, I want you to make your analytics page public.
            And if you don’t administrate a portal, I want you convince your local portal
            administrator to. It’s just one box in administrator dashboard that you need to click.</p>
            
            <p>Open data!</p>
