Thomas,

Thank you so much for the offer to write a blog. That sounds ideal. Jason's
post is a great one to work from, if you're up for telling the story of
your visit.

I also love the idea of you telling purely about what you're into and why
and how you do what you do. If you ever want to write a post just focused
on that, we're happy to publish it.

Maybe start with a high-level "what / why I do what I do and how that
brought me to Socrata." Anything from 300-600 words is great. Then, another
time maybe, you can write in more detail about your interests and passions.

I'm sorry that I missed the opportunity to meet you. Maybe another time.

Please send your post to me and cc Patrick. Would you maybe have it ready
this week? Posting it on Friday would be best (within a week), if you could
write it by early-ish Thursday. If you have any images from your trip to
Seattle that you'd like to include, please send a couple along.

Thanks,

Bridget
