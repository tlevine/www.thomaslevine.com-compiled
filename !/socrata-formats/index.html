            <p>I found some more open data about open data to <a href="/socrata">study</a>!
            While <a href="http://www.socrata.com/blog/my-visit-to-socrata-and-data-analysis-about-data-analysis/">at Socrata’s office</a> on Friday,
            I learned of the <a href="https://data.oregon.gov/data.json"><code>/data.json</code></a> endpoint.
            It contains an entry for each <a href="/!/socrata-genealogies/#term-dataset">dataset</a>,
            uploaded by the data publisher; it doesn’t contain all of the other
            views that are based on these source datasets.
            And it has <a href="http://project-open-data.github.io/schema/">this format</a>.</p>
            
            <h2 id="how-many-datasets">How many datasets?</h2>
            <p>Socrata portals have <a href="/!/socrata-users/#the-user-data-format">50,000 different views</a>, but only
            8922 are original datasets.</p>
            
            <p>The <code>/data.json</code> files include federated datasets, so some of these
            datasets are duplicated. I did not remove duplicates, so I’m working
            with 15699 datasets, with a median of
            96 datasets per portal.</p>
            
            <p><a href="figure/portal-counts.png"><img src="figure/portal-counts.png" alt="Datasets per portal, based on the /data.json file" class="wide" /></a></p>
            
            <h3 id="no-derived-datasets">No derived datasets</h3>
            <p>This is much lower than my <a href="/!/socrata-summary">earlier figure</a>
            because the present figure does not include <a href="/!/socrata-genealogies#soda-queries-filtered-views-charts-maps">derived views</a> (map, charts, &amp;c.).</p>
            
            <p>Some time, I’ll compare the within-portal counts of original datasets
            and derived datasets. But not right now.</p>
            
            <h3 id="federated-data">Federated data</h3>
            <p>It still includes <a href="/!/socrata-genealogies/#term-federation">federated data</a> (duplicates),
            however, and this file doesn’t make it easy to determine which direction
            the federation is in. The following plot gives us an idea of how many of
            these datasets are duplicates.</p>
            
            <p><a href="figure/federation.png"><img src="figure/federation.png" alt="The scale of data federation within this subset of Socrata datasets" class="wide" /></a></p>
            
            <p>Most of the datasets are not duplicates, but some are duplicated many times.</p>
            
            <p>Some day, I’ll look more at federation, probably by 
            reading the federation information from home pages of the portals
            or by following the links in the <code>/data.json</code> file.</p>
            
            <h3 id="cutoff-at-1000">Cutoff at 1000?</h3>
            <p>I find it highly suspicious the following nine portals have exactly 1000
            datasets and no portals have more than 1000 datasets.</p>
            
            <pre><code>paste(names(sort(table(datasets$portal), decreasing = T)[1:9]), collapse = "\n")&#x000A;</code></pre>
            
            <ul>
              <li><a href="https://bronx.lehman.cuny.edu">bronx.lehman.cuny.edu</a></li>

            </ul>
            
            <p>Half of these portals federate <code>explore.data.gov</code>, which has quite a few datasets, and the JSON
            files seem to just include some of the <code>explore.data.gov</code> data. I think these
            files have only the first 1000 datasets, and I haven’t figured out how to look
            at the next pages, so I’ll focus the present analysis on portals with fewer
            than 1000 datasets.</p>
            
            <h2 id="my-curiousity-about-file-formats">My curiousity about file formats</h2>
            <p>I’ve recently become curious about what formats the datasets come from. When
            tabular data get loaded into a Socrata data portal, they get converted to a
            tabular representation within the portal software. From that, they get converted
            to a range of different tabular formats.</p>
            
            <p>The Socrata data portal doesn’t explicitly store the source format because of
            how the import process works. Most of the data <a href="http://blog.scraperwiki.com/2012/07/31/do-all-analysts-use-excel/">probably come from Excel</a>,
            and the data that aren’t from Excel typically come from inside of a government
            network where policies would make it inconvenient to expose the database to the
            world. Because of this, Socrata doesn’t query database servers. Instead, data
            publishers write middlemen that act as both database clients and Socrata clients.
            They query the database and then make <a href="http://dev.socrata.com/publishers/getting-started">web requests</a>
            to the Socrata portal.</p>
            
            <h2 id="datajson-contains-file-format-information"><code>/data.json</code> contains file format information</h2>
            <p>The <code>/data.json</code> endpoint contains a file format field per the Project Open Data
            schema. This refers to the format of the data as served from the Socrata portal,
            not the format it was stored in before it got to the Socrata portal. But this
            still tells us something about the source file formats.</p>
            
            <p>People sometimes upload things that Socrata doesn’t interpret as tables. PDFs are
            a major example. Other times, people upload or link to
            files that could be tables but don’t specify that they are tables; those are called
            “external links”. Read more on dataset types <a href="/!/open-by-default#types-of-visualizations-on-socrata-portals">here</a>.</p>
            
            <p>Data formats are represented in two fields, <code>format</code> and <code>distribution</code>. <code>distribution</code>{#distribution}
            seems to contain all of the different available formats. If the data are imported as
            tabular data, it contains CSV, JSON, XML, &amp;c., all served from the Socrata site.
            And if the data are external links, it will contain a few external links, still
            specifying the file types. The <code>format</code> field contains one of the formats that are
            specified in the <code>distribution</code> field. I think it’s just the first of the formats.
            For the present analysis, I’m using the <code>format</code> field.</p>
            
            <p>Recall that the present dataset of datasets counts federated datasets multiple times.
            The following plot shows the file types of the deduplicated dataset dataset, across
            all portals.</p>
            
            <p><a href="figure/deduplicated.png"><img src="figure/deduplicated.png" alt="Formats of datasets across all portals" class="wide" /></a></p>
            
            <p>And here are some of the main types by portal, counting federated datasets in all of their portals.</p>
            
            <p><a href="figure/all-formats.png"><img src="figure/all-formats.png" alt="Data formats on all the portals" class="wide" /></a></p>
            
            <p><code>csv</code> mostly refers
            to data that Socrata represents as a table; this is the sort of data that Socrata
            can convert to a range of different tabular data formats.
            It is also my <a href="http://csvsoundsystem.com">preferred file format</a>.</p>
            
            <p>Everything that is not CSV appears to be an external link.</p>
            
            <h2 id="csv">CSV</h2>
            <p>Most datasets are CSV (8143 of 15699).
            I was curious as to how this varies by portal and over time, and the following image
            addresses that.</p>
            
            <p><a href="figure/csv-cum-facet.png"><img src="figure/csv-cum-facet.png" alt="Dataset formats by portal over time" class="wide" /></a></p>
            
            <p>The image above contains one plot per data portal. The x-axis of each plot is the date,
            the y-axis is the proportion<sup id="fnref:proportion"><a href="#fn:proportion" class="footnote">1</a></sup> of datasets that are tabular (CSV), and the
            width of the line is the number of datasets on the portal.
            For example, if there were 100 datasets on a portal in June 2011 and 80 were CSV, the
            line would be near the top of the graph and quite skinny at June 2011.</p>
            
            <p>We can thus see how many datasets each portal has and what the different formats are.</p>
            
            <h2 id="some-interesting-portals">Some interesting portals</h2>
            <p>Some portals have only CSV data (like <code>data.medicare.gov</code>), but most contain
            other data. I am curious both as to what other data formats they have and what
            prompted the shifts in dataset format.</p>
            
            <p>Missouri mostly has PDFs.</p>
            
            <p><a href="figure/mo.png"><img src="figure/mo.png" alt="Data formats on data.mo.gov" class="wide" /></a></p>
            
            <p>Also interesting about Missouri is that it federates <a href="https://data.kcmo.org/">Kansas City</a>,
            which didn’t appear in my list of portals.</p>
            
            <p>I know I said I’d focus on portals with fewer than 1000 datasets, but Lehman College is
            interesting because it has lots of zipped files.</p>
            
            <p><a href="figure/lehman.png"><img src="figure/lehman.png" alt="Data formats on bronx.lehman.cuny.edu" class="wide" /></a></p>
            
            <p>San Francisco has a lot of CSVs, a lot of externally linked zip files,
            and a lot of externally linked files of unknown format.</p>
            
            <p><a href="figure/sf.png"><img src="figure/sf.png" alt="Data formats on data.sfgov.org" class="wide" /></a></p>
            
            <h2 id="determination-of-external-link-file-formats">Determination of external link file formats</h2>
            <p>It looks like the format of external links is determined by the file name.
            For example, Edmonton’s
            <a href="https://data.edmonton.ca/Transportation/Road-and-Traffic-Updates/5ggc-prfp?">Road and Traffic Updates</a>
            are marked as <code>application/rss+xml</code> because the external link,
            <a href="http://www.trumba.com/calendars/construction-and-special-events-road-closures.rss">http://www.trumba.com/calendars/construction-and-special-events-road-closures.rss</a>,
            ends in <code>.rss</code>.</p>
            
            <p>In contrast, the <a href="https://data.maryland.gov/d/ywbg-ptfh">Maryland Land Use/ Land Cover: 1973, 2002, 2010</a>
            dataset is marked as having the format <code>application/octet-stream</code> because the
            external link, <a href="http://planning.maryland.gov/OurWork/landUseDownload.shtml">http://planning.maryland.gov/OurWork/landUseDownload.shtml</a>,
            ends in <code>.shtml</code>.</p>
            
            <!-- sqldf("select title, 'https://' || portal || '/d/' || identifier AS portalURL, accessURL from catalog where identifier = 'ywbg-ptfh'", dbname = '/tmp/catalog.db') -->
            
            <h2 id="dates-of-significant-changes">Dates of significant changes</h2>
            <p>A few portals have only CSV data since the beginning, but most have had other formats.
            Looking at the plots, we can see dates where there was a sudden change in the proportion
            of datasets that were CSV.</p>
            
            <h3 id="sudden-changes-at-the-beginning">Sudden changes at the beginning</h3>
            <p>When the first dataset gets uploaded, the proportion of datasets that are CSV is either
            zero or one. Thus, the line for all of these datasets starts either at zero or one.
            Most datasets sharply change after that; <code>data.austintexas.gov</code> and <code>data.mo.gov</code> are
            examples.</p>
            
            <p>Others stay at this level for quite a while because no datasets were uploaded for a
            while. <code>data.raleighnc.gov</code> is an example of this. Here are its first ten datasets.</p>

            <p>The first two datasets were uploaded in the middle of March 2012 and were CSV format,
            making the datasets 100% CSV. The next was uploaded in the middle of February 2013 and
            was also CSV, so the proportion was still 100% CSV. At the end of the month, six
            zip files were uploaded, reducing the proportion to 33% CSV.</p>
            
            <h3 id="sudden-changes-after-the-beginning">Sudden changes after the beginning</h3>
            <p><code>data.sfgov.org</code> had a sudden change in the proportion of datasets that were CSV, but
            it was after a long while, so a lot of related datasets might have been uploaded all
            at once. Let’s look at when datasets were uploaded.</p>

            <p>This has the quite similar information to the earlier plots, but it’s a bit more precise.
            San Francisco added lots of datasets in January 2012, November 2012, and December 2012, and proportionately
            few of these datasets were CSV. What were they?</p>

            <p>It looks like January is mostly externally linked, zipped shapefiles. Most of the
            datasets say “shapefile” in their <code>title</code>, <code>description</code> or <a href="#distribution"><code>distribution</code></a> fields.</p>
            
            <p><a href="figure/sf-shapefile.png"><img src="figure/sf-shapefile.png" alt="Formats of newly open San Francisco datasets over time" class="wide" /></a></p>
            
            <p>And a lot of the rest of the January files look like zipped shapefiles, even though the
            titles and descriptions don’t say so.</p>
            
            <p>So San Francisco suddenly uploaded a bunch of shapefiles in January and November/December.</p>
            
            <h3 id="plateaus-of-dataset-counts">Plateaus of dataset counts</h3>
            <p>Some of the plots make it look like lots of datasets were suddenly uploaded one time
            and no datasets were uploaded again. This is mainly for the
            <a href="#cutoff-at-1000">portals with more than 1000 datasets</a>,
            so I think this is because we’re seeing only the first 1000 datasets.</p>
            
            <h2 id="csv-pdf-zip-and-octet-stream">CSV, pdf, zip and octet-stream</h2>
            <p>Based on the examples above, it seems like a lot of datasets are PDF, zip or unknown
            external links. I made the following series of plots to check it. It is just like the
            <a href="#csv">similar image above</a> except for the y-axes; instead of representing the
            proportion of datasets that are CSV, each y-axis represents the proportion of datasets
            that are CSV, PDF, zip or unknown external links.</p>
            
            <p><a href="figure/csv-pdf-zip-octet-cum-facet.png"><img src="figure/csv-pdf-zip-octet-cum-facet.png" alt="Dataset formats by portal over time" class="wide" /></a></p>
            
            <p>Most of the curves are pretty straight and stay near 1, meaning that the proportion doesn’t
            change much and that the proportion is quite high. Thus, it looks like most datasets are
            either CSV, pdf, zip or external links of unknown format.</p>
            
            <h2 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h2>
            
            <h3 id="formats">Formats</h3>
            <p>I was mainly wondering about the source formats of the data. It turns out that most datasets
            are tables. Aside from tables, there are lots of externally linked files, mostly PDFs and zip archives.</p>
            
            <h3 id="shapefiles">Shapefiles</h3>
            <p>I’ve been thinking recently about how to infer the organizational structure of a municipality
            based on the open data that they release, and the finding with the San Francisco shapefiles
            alludes to this. It might be that one department within the San Francisco government manages
            and uses most of the geospatial data and that the open data team happened to work with them
            in January, November and December of 2012.</p>
            
            <h2 id="future-study">Future study</h2>
            <p>This got me thinking about other ways of studying file formats.</p>
            
            <h3 id="the-attribution-field">The attribution field</h3>
            <p>Socrata’s SODA 1 API, which I’ve <a href="/!/socrata-summary/#download-dataset-metadata">used before</a>,
            contains an <code>attribution</code> field, which references the URL from
            which the dataset was taken.<sup id="fnref:attribution"><a href="#fn:attribution" class="footnote">2</a></sup> This would be one
            way of figuring out the source format, or at least some related information about the source.</p>
            
            <h3 id="externally-linked-csvs">Externally linked CSVs</h3>
            <p>Not all of the CSV-formatted datasets necessarily come from Socrata; some might be links
            to external CSV files. There is enough information in <code>/data.json</code> to determine which of
            these categories a CSV dataset falls into.</p>
            
            <h3 id="determining-the-formats-of-external-links">Determining the formats of external links</h3>
            <p>It looks to me like the format type of external links is determined based on the file
            extension of the URL; <code>octet-stream</code> datasets seem to correspond to URLs without file
            extensions or with file extensions like <code>aspx</code> that don’t clearly correspond to a
            particular file types. One could determine the formats of these datasets by
            downloading the files.</p>
