            <h2 id="data-means-table">“Data” means “table”</h2>
            <p>I don’t really like to distinguish between data and anything else
            because <a href="/!/world-data-world">everything is data to me</a>. But I sort
            of do make a distinction, and here it is.</p>
            
            <blockquote>
              <p>Data are things in data tables</p>
            </blockquote>
            
            <p>Once we express the world in data tables, we can study it with a
            wide body of analytical tools that expect data to be in tables.
            When we work with tables so much, we come up with lots of fancy
            words to describe all of the different parts of a table.</p>
            
            <h2 id="rows-and-columns">Rows and columns</h2>
            <p>Here’s a data table.</p>
            
            <p><img src="" alt="A handwritten data table" /></p>
            
            <p>It has a grid with a value in each of the rectangular boxes.
            Being this sort of grid, it has columns and rows. These columns
            and rows mean special things.</p>
            
            <h3 id="rows">Rows</h3>
            <p>The very first line in that table says “id, location, …”.
            This line is called the “header”, and we’ll get to that later.</p>
            
            <p>The rest of the lines are all <em>rows</em>.
            A data table represents a collection of things, and each individual
            thing is represented as a row. For example, this table is about a
            collection of XXX, so each row is a XXX.</p>
            
            <p><img src="" alt="The same handwritten data table, but with a row of the table highlighted" /></p>
            
            <p>It is quite important to know that each row is a XXX, so we have a
            name for this relationship; we say that XXX is the the <em>statistical unit</em>
            in this data table.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Synonyms</strong>: Rows are also called <em>records</em></p>
            
            <h3 id="columns">Columns</h3>
            <p>In this data table, we have recorded a bunch of information about
            each XXX. More precisely, we have recorded the same sorts of information
            about each XXX. For example, the first box in each row contains the YYY
            for that XXX, and the second box in each row contains the ZZZ for the XXX.</p>
            
            <p>Thus, all of the values in a given column are about the same sort of thing.
            For example, the second column contains all of the ZZZs. We usually indicate
            this in the header line; we know that the second column contains ZZZs because
            the box at the top of the column says “ZZZ”.</p>
            
            <p><img src="" alt="The same handwritten data table, but with a column of the table highlighted" /></p>
            
            <p><strong>Synonyms</strong>: Columns are also called <em>variables</em> and <em>features</em>. These words
            sound very fancy, but they’re not; when a data scientist says “variable” or
            “feature”, he’s just using a fancy word for “column”.</p>
            
            <h4 id="another-meaning-of-variable">Another meaning of “variable”</h4>
            <p>This meaning of the word “variable” can be confusing if you were taught a different
            meaning of “variable” in school. If you are used to this meaning, you’ll think that
            <em>x</em> in the following equation is a variable.</p>
            
            <script type="math/tex; mode=display">12 = x + 7</script>
            
            <p>I usually think of these as different meanings of the word “variable”,
            but it turns out that these two senses of “variable” are quite related.
            The next paragraph explains how they are related. This relationship usually
            confuses me, so it might confuse you. If it does, just ignore the next paragraph
            and go on.</p>
            
            <p>Once we have created a data table, we might decide to make a fancy equation that
            explains how some values in the table are related to each other. We might call
            this a <em>model</em>. It might be something like this.</p>
            
            <script type="math/tex; mode=display">Sunday ridership = Saturday ridership - 1 million people</script>
            
            <p>In this model, Sunday ridership and Saturday ridership are
            just numbers that we take from one row of the table.
            To make that look more like what you might be used to, let’s
            rewrite it like this.</p>
            
            <script type="math/tex; mode=display">y = x - 1 million people</script>
            
            <p>A model allows us to express complex things with more simply.
            The model won’t be exactly right, of course; it’s just a model.
            One way we can use a model is to make predictions. Typically we
            write the equation such that the left side is the thing we are
            predicting and the right side is the stuff we know.</p>
            
            <p>The last row in our data table is the observation for this year.
            Note that we don’t have a value for the “actual spending” column.
            That’s because we’ll have to wait a few months before we see what
            the government spends this year. We don’t want to wait that long,
            so let’s use our model to predict it. We know <em>x</em>, so let’s plug
            that in.</p>
            
            <!-- maybe switch this for something simpler, like inmates in jail next month -->
            
            <script type="math/tex; mode=display">y = 8 - 3 </script>
            
            <p>When we have such an equation, we can plug in the values we know
            and solve for the value on the left side.</p>
            
            <p>Let’s get back to why these two senses of variable are the same
            thing. One sense is a column in a table, and the other sense is
            an unknown in an equation. A variable in the column sense is just
            a lot of variables in the latter sense; we’re solving the same
            equation lots of times (as many times as we have rows), by
            plugging in different values for the same unknows.</p>
            
            <p><img src="" alt="Explanatory picture" /></p>
            
            <h2 id="lists">Lists</h2>
            <p>Earlier, I said that a column is a special list of values. We could also say</p>
            
            <p>(Actually, people might say <em>vector</em> instead of <em>list</em>, but they mean
            pretty much the same thing.)</p>
            
            <h3 id="you-cant-switch-them">You can’t switch them</h3>
            <p>You could make a data table where rows are variables and columns are records,
            but hardly anyone does that, and I get confused when people do.</p>
