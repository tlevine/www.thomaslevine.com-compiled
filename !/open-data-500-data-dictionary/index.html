            <p>The <a href="http://www.opendata500.com/download/">Open Data 500</a> is
            “the first comprehensive study of U.S. companies using open government data to develop new products and services.”
            You may have read about it in.

            This is <a href="/open-data">data about open data</a>, so I naturally wanted it.</p>
            
            <p>The Open Data 500 Team doesn’t provide a data dictionary, so I pieced one
            together for my own purposes. And I figured somebody else might want it for
            her own purposes, so here it is. The present article discusses</p>
            
            <ul>
              <li>What the Open Data 500 is, in terms of research methods</li>
              <li>How the released data files are structured</li>
              <li>Clarification of some possible points of confusion</li>
              <li>Recommendations as to how to work with the data</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h2 id="data-collection-methods">Data collection methods</h2>
            <p>The Open Data 500 looks a bit scary and complicated when you read its website
            and the articles about it, but the Open Data 500 is pretty much just a
            straightforward questionnaire survey.</p>
            
            <h3 id="the-population-of-interest">The population of interest</h3>
            <p>The Open Data 500 Team is interested in companies that meet their
            <a href="http://www.opendata500.com/about/#about-eligibility">eligibility criteria</a>,
            which they describe as follows.</p>
            
            <ol>
              <li>Be U.S.-based – which can include international companies with a major presence in the U.S.</li>
              <li>Earn revenue from its products and services. In addition to for-profit companies, nonprofits may qualify if they support themselves primarily through sales of products and services rather than philanthropy.</li>
              <li>Use open government data as a critical resource for its business. (While most Open Data 500 companies will work with federal data, the study will also include some that use city or state data if their work can scale regionally or nationally)</li>
            </ol>
            
            <p>The Open Data 500 site does not explain how they operationalize these criteria,
            but I presume that it works as follows.</p>
            
            <ol>
              <li>The questionnaire must indicate that a company has a major presence in the U.S.</li>
              <li>The answer to “Which of the following are significant sources of revenue for your company?”
              must include something other than “Philanthropy”.</li>
              <li>The answer to “Which of the following are critical sources of data for your company?”
              must include “Federal Open Data”, the questionnaire must indicate elsewhere that
              the company is using state or city data from a range of states or cities.</li>
            </ol>
            
            <p>They are “<a href="http://www.opendata500.com/about/#about-vetted">vetting</a>” companies,
            but this sounds like just a conversation with the submitters to check that they
            understood the questionnaire properly.</p>
            
            <h3 id="comprehensive-call-sampling-strategy">Comprehensive call sampling strategy</h3>
            <p>The Open Data 500 uses a sampling strategy that they term “comprehensive call”.
            That sounds really complicated, but it’s actually quite simple.</p>
            
            <p>The questionnaire results can be considered a convenience sample
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accidental_sampling">convenience sample</a>
            of companies that meet the Open Data 500 eligibility criteria.</p>
            
            <p>The Open Data 500 Team distributed links to the questionnaire in
            <a href="http://www.opendata500.com/about/#about-identify">these places</a>.</p>

            <p>That’s all that “comprehensive call” means!</p>
            
            <p>I think their use of comprehensive call is why the Open Data 500 Team considers
            the Open Data 500 to be a comprehensive study.</p>
            
            <h3 id="undocumented-data-collection">Undocumented data collection</h3>
            <p>Open Data 500 Team solicited responses to
            <a href="http://www.opendata500.com/submitCompany/">this questionnaire</a> through
            <a href="#comprehensive-call-sampling-strategy">comprehensive call</a>,
             but they also looked for companies
            that did not respond to the questionnaire.</p>
            
            <p>I couldn’t find any documentation about the process they went through for
            collecting data without the questionnaire. After talking to one of the Team
            members, I think that the Team collected data about these companies without
            talking directly to anyone who works there, but I do not know how they chose
            the companies nor how they collected the data.</p>
            
            <h3 id="case-study">Case study</h3>
            <p>In both the questionnaire section of the study and in the undocumented data
            collection, only companies that meet the eligibility criteria are considered.
            Thus, the Open Data 500 is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_study">case study</a>
            of companies that meet the Open Data 500 eligibility criteria; there is not
            a control group of companies that do not meet the criteria.</p>
            
            <h2 id="just-a-questionnaire">Just a questionnaire</h2>
            <p>This is the main thing that confused me about the study, so I’m going to
            explain this part in a bit more depth in case anyone else was also confused.</p>
            
            <p>Aside from the undocumented data collection, which produces only coarse information,
            the data collection for the Open Data 500 is just the questionnaire.
            <strong>Really</strong>.
            For example, the Team isn’t looking at companies products to see which open data
            are used, and it isn’t looking at annual reports to determine whether the
            company does a lot of business in the United States. This is confusing because
            the data releases do not look like the questionnaire, but I’m pretty sure that
            the data come rather directly from the questionnaire.</p>
            
            <h2 id="sample-size">Sample size</h2>
            <p>It is unclear to me how many companies responded to the questionnaire, but I
            think it is either 51 companies or
            100 companies.
            I explain this more in the
            <a href="#which-companies-are-in-the-preview?">Which companies are in the preview?</a>
            section.</p>
            
            <h2 id="pre-launch">Pre-launch</h2>
            <p>According to the “<a href="http://www.opendata500.com/about">About</a>” page on the
            Open Data 500 site, the Open Data 500 “will identify, describe, and analyze
            companies that use open government data in their businesses.”</p>
            
            <p>As I understand it, the analysis component of this has yet to occur.
            At the moment, the Open Data 500 is in “pre-launch”. This means that they have
            begun to collect data but that they haven’t done any sort of analysis on it.
            (This part isn’t explained on the website, but a member of the Open Data 500
            Team explained this to me in person.)</p>
            
            <h2 id="data-files">Data files</h2>
            <p>The Open Data 500 Team has released six main data files.</p>
            
            <ul>
              <li><a href="http://www.opendata500.com/download/Preview50_Companies.csv"><code>Preview50_Companies.csv</code></a></li>
              <li><a href="http://www.opendata500.com/download/500_Companies.csv"><code>500_Companies.csv</code></a></li>
              <li><a href="http://www.opendata500.com/download/OD500_Companies.json"><code>OD500_Companies.json</code></a></li>
              <li><a href="http://www.opendata500.com/download/OD500_Datasets.json"><code>OD500_Datasets.json</code></a></li>
              <li><a href="http://www.opendata500.com/preview/"><code>preview</code></a> (HTML)</li>
              <li><a href="http://www.opendata500.com/candidates/"><code>candidates</code></a> (HTML)</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>There are also individual pages about each company, but I’m pretty sure that
            the only extra information on those is comments submitted through the comment
            forms.</p>
            
            <h3 id="preview50companiescsv">Preview50_Companies.csv</h3>
            <p><a href="http://www.opendata500.com/download/Preview50_Companies.csv"><code>Preview50_Companies.csv</code></a>
            is a denormalized CSV file with
            25 columns and 102 rows.
            Each row corresponds to a dataset within a company, and
            each column corresponds to a question from the
            <a href="http://www.opendata500.com/submitCompany/">questionnaire</a>.
            51 different companies are
            represented in this dataset.</p>
            
            <p>The column names in this file correspond quite closely to the name
            attributes in the HTML form source code for the questionnaire.</p>
            
            <p>These columns describe the companies, and they are identical across different
            rows about the same company. </p>

            <h2 id="distintion-between-the-preview-and-the-candidates">Distintion between the “Preview” and the “Candidates”</h2>
            <p>The Open Data 500 Team released an
            “<a href="http://www.opendata500.com/preview/">in-depth view</a>” of “50 of the first
            to complete [the] survey”. They also released a
            “<a href="http://www.opendata500.com/candidates/">full list</a>” of
            “500 candidate companies”.</p>
            
            <p>I explained earlier that some data were collected through a questionnaire
            and that others were collected through an undocumented process. The “preview”
            companies are the ones for which the data were collected by questionnaire;
            the “candidates” include both these companies and the companies whose data
            were collected by the undocumented means. Here’s how I figured that out.</p>
            
            <h3 id="are-they-just-the-companies-that-have-submitted-questionnaires">Are they just the companies that have submitted questionnaires?</h3>
            <p>The preview companies are simply all of the companies that have
            submitted the questionnaire; the non-preview companies are companies for
            which the the Open Data 500 team effectively filled out the questionnaire.</p>
            
            <p>I came to that conclusion by looking at the following plot. In this plot,
            the height of the bars represents the number of companies in a particular
            category. The left category is companies that have completed the questionnaire,
            and the right category is companies that haven’t. (The Open Data 500 Team
            collect information about the companies but not through a questionnaire.)
            The datasets are also color-coded based on whether the companies are included
            in the Preview set.</p>

            <p>Note that the entire left bar is blue and the entire right bar is red;
            this means that all of the survey companies are in the preview set and
            that none of the non-survey companies are in the preview set.</p>
            
            <p>Well maybe. Given what I’m about to say in the next section, I’m starting
            to wonder whether there was a mistake in the HTML version.</p>
            
            <h2 id="which-companies-are-in-the-preview">Which companies are in the preview?</h2>
            <p>I still haven’t resolved which companies are considered to be the preview
            companies.</p>
            
            <h3 id="companies">51 companies?</h3>
            <p>Three of the files (<code>Preview50_Companies.csv</code>, <code>OD500_Companies.json</code>,
            and <code>preview</code>) agree as to which companies are in the preview.</p>
            
            <pre><code>all(setequal(preview.companies.csv, preview.companies.json), setequal(preview.companies.csv, &#x000A;    preview.companies.preview.html))&#x000A;## [1] TRUE&#x000A;</code></pre>
            
            <p>According to those three files, the following
            51 companies are in the preview.</p>
            
            <pre><code> [1] "Archimedes Inc."          "Azavea"                  &#x000A; [3] "BillGuard"                "BuildZoom"               &#x000A; [5] "Calcbench, Inc."

            <h3 id="companies-1">100 companies?</h3>
            <p>The remaining file, <code>candidates</code>, agrees that the above companies are in
            the preview,</p>
            
            <pre><code>setequal(intersect(preview.companies.candidates.html, preview.companies.csv), &#x000A;    preview.companies.csv)&#x000A;## [1] TRUE&#x000A;</code></pre>
            
            <p>but it includes 49  additional companies, for a total of 100.</p>
            
            <h3 id="companies-2">50 companies?</h3>
            <p>There is even a third conflicting concept of the preview!
            Several articles indicate that there are 50 companies in the preview,
            not 51 nor 100.</p>
            
            <p>The introduction to the <a href="http://www.opendata500.com/preview/"><code>preview</code></a> page says
            “[t]hese companies are 50 of the first to complete our survey for the Open Data 500”.
            The <a href="http://www.opendata500.com/download/">download</a> page calls the preview
            files “List[s] of 50”. The <a href="http://www.opendata500.com/">home page</a> says that the
            preview is the “list of the first 50 companies that have filled out our survey”.</p>
            
            <p>The various press coverage also counts the preview companies at 50.
            The article in
            <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/bethsimonenoveck/2014/01/08/from-faith-based-to-evidence-based-the-open-data-500-and-understanding-how-open-data-helps-the-american-economy/">Forbes</a>
            says “We’ve also posted in-depth profiles of 50 of them”.
            The <a href="http://www.informationweek.com/government/open-government/open-government-data-companies-cash-in/d/d-id/1113143">Information Week</a> article
            says that “[i]n addition to publishing a list of 500 open data companies,
            GovLab also published profiles of 50 companies creating value from open government data.”
            And the <a href="http://fedscoop.com/open-data-500-intersection-open-data-economy/">Fedscoop</a> article
            talks about “50 companies profiled for early release”.</p>
            
            <h2 id="which-companies-are-the-candidates">Which companies are the candidates?</h2>
            <p>There are also slight conflicts as to what the full list of companies is.</p>
            
            <h3 id="what-the-data-files-say">What the data files say</h3>
            <p><code>500_Companies.csv</code> contains 503 companies, and
            <code>candidates</code> contains 501 companies.
            Collectively, they list 505 different
            companies, and they agree about 498 of these 505 companies.</p>
            
            <pre><code>csv &lt;- cset(sub(" *$", "", candidates.csv$CompanyName))&#x000A;html &lt;- cset(sub(" *$", "", as.character(candidates.html$name)))&#x000A;</code></pre>
            
            <p>These are in the CSV but not in the HTML.</p>
            
            <pre><code>print(cset_difference(csv, html))&#x000A;## {"Bureau Blank", "Capital Access Network", "DocGraph Journal",&#x000A;##  "Opower", "Spikes Cavell"}&#x000A;</code></pre>
            
            <p>These are in the HTML but not in the CSV.</p>
            
            <pre><code>print(cset_difference(html, csv))&#x000A;## {"CAN Capital", "Roadify", "Spikes Cavell Analytic Inc"}&#x000A;</code></pre>
            
            <h3 id="what-the-descriptions-in-english-say">What the descriptions in English say</h3>
            <p>Much of the Open Data 500 website references a list of 500 companies.
            The <a href="http://www.opendata500.com/download">download page</a> refers to
            <a href="http://www.opendata500.com/download/500_Companies.csv"><code>500_Companies.csv</code></a>
            as the “List of 500 Candidates”. And the three news articles linked from
            the homepage also reference a list of 500 companies.</p>
            
            <h2 id="ness">500-ness</h2>
            <p>I’m still unsure as to what the “500” in the title means.
            As we saw above, it might have something to do with the number of responses,
            but I find it odd that someone would name a study after its sample size.
            So there’s probably more to it.</p>
            
            <h3 id="fortune-500">Fortune 500?</h3>
            <p>Many people have suggested that the name is allusion to
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortune_500">Fortune 500</a>,
            but I don’t think that’s it.
            The Fortune 500 is list of “the top 500 U.S. closely held and public
            corporations as ranked by their gross revenue after adjustments”. That is,
            it’s the 500 biggest U.S. companies for a particular definition of “big”.</p>
            
            <p>The Fortune 500 and the Open Data 500 are both about U.S. companies, but
            the similarities stop there; as explained on the
            “<a href="http://www.opendata500.com/about/#about-results">About</a>” page,
            the Open Data 500 is explicitly not a ranking and not about company size.</p>
            
            <h3 id="number-of-responses">Number of responses?</h3>
            <p>The website says that the Open Data 500 is a list of 500 companies, so it
            might be that the “500” refers to the number of companies that they listed.
            As I said above, naming studies after their sample size is a bit odd.
            It seems like they continued looking for companies until they came up with
            500, but I don’t understand why they chose the number 500.</p>
            
            <p>The Open Data 500 website <a href="http://www.opendata500.com/about/#about-results">says</a>
            that “the Open Data 500 study is not meant to provide information for definitive
            statistical analysis”, so I doubt they did anything like a power analysis to
            determine how many they needed.</p>
            
            <p>One member of the Team told me that this was just a big number as a challenge
            to themselves. Another told me that they expected, based on Joel Gurin’s
            network, that there were about 500 companies that would respond.</p>
            
            <h2 id="key-points-and-recommendations">Key points and recommendations</h2>
            <p>That was a lot of details of the Open Data 500 data. Let’s see if I can
            summarize my conclusions about the structure of the study and the data.</p>
            
            <h3 id="two-sub-studies">Two sub-studies</h3>
            <p>The Open Data 500 Team is assembling two lists.</p>
            
            <p><strong>The shorter list</strong> (called the “preview” or the “list of 50”) is the
            results of a questionnaire, with one response per company. This part is
            a straightforward questionnaire-based case study, and the data that get
            released come directly from the questionnaires.</p>
            
            <p><strong>The longer list</strong> (called the “list of 500 candidates”) makes more sense
            if you think about it as the sum of two lists; some of the companies come from
            the shorter list (the questionnaire responses), and the rest (most) come from
            an undocumented process.</p>
            
            <h3 id="which-data-files-you-should-use">Which data files you should use</h3>
            <p><strong>If you are interested in the questionnaire results</strong>, I recommend using the
            <a href="http://www.opendata500.com/download/Preview50_Companies.csv"><code>Preview50_Companies.csv</code></a>
            file; this file is structured more simply than the corresponding JSON files
            (<a href="http://www.opendata500.com/download/OD500_Companies.json"><code>OD500_Companies.json</code></a>
            and <a href="http://www.opendata500.com/download/OD500_Datasets.json"><code>OD500_Datasets.json</code></a>).</p>
            
            <p><strong>If you are interested in the long list</strong>, choose your data file based on the
            fields you want and based on whether you want the full list or an incomplete list.
            The two files contain different columns; for example, the flag as to whether the
            data come from the questionnaire or the undocumented process is only available
            in the HTML version,
            and the link to the company website is only available in the CSV version.
            Thus, you need to choose the file based on which fields you need.
            Also, each of these files contains different companies; if you want to have the
            full list of companies, you need to combine these files, removing duplicates.</p>
            
            <p><strong>I’ve already loaded the data into R</strong>, so look
            <a href="#loading-into-r">here</a> if you want that.</p>
            
            <h3 id="other-confusing-things">Other confusing things</h3>
            <p><strong>The “500” in “Open Data 500” doesn’t mean anything</strong> as far as I can tell;
            it’s not the number of responses, and it’s not a reference to the Fortune 500.
            Don’t let this confuse you.</p>
            
            <p><strong>The Open Data 500 is considered “comprehensive” because of its sampling strategy</strong>,
            which is termed “comprehensive call”. This strategy is a form of convenience sampling.</p>
            
            <p><strong>The Open Data 500 is only at data collection stage</strong>; the “analysis”
            component of the study has yet to begin. But the data are already being
            released, so you can start analyzing the data before the Open Data 500
            Team does!</p>
            
            <p><strong>The different data files present conflicting versions of the data</strong>,
            and I haven’t figured out how to resolve this.
            The different data files do largely agree with each other,
            so they should be okay for prototyping your analyses, but you should contact the
            Open Data 500 Team for clarification if this starts to matter.</p>
